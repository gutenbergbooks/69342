<h3>AMONG THE APPLE BLOSSOMS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE young man drew up his horse at the
side of the dusty road and looked across the
barbed-wire fence into the orchard beyond.
Far distant against the horizon could be seen the
blue mountain range of the Big Horns, sharp-toothed,
with fields of snow lying in the gulches. But in the
valley basin where he rode an untempered sun, too hot
for May, beat upon his brown neck and through the
gray flannel shirt stretched taut across his flat back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trees were clouds of soft blossoms and the
green alfalfa beneath looked delightfully cool. Warm
and dry from travel as he was, that shadowy paradise
of pink and white bloom and lush deep grass called
mightily to him. A reader of character might have
guessed that handsome Larry Silcott followed the
line of least resistance. If his face betrayed no
weakness, certainly it showed self-satisfaction, an
assured smug acceptance of the fact that he was
popular and knew it. Yet his friends, and he had
many of them, would have protested that word smug.
He was a good fellow, amiable, friendly, anxious to
please. At dance and round-up he always had a smile
or a laugh ready.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught a glimpse of the weathered roof of the
ranch house where the rambling road dipped into a
draw. Well, it would wait there for him. There
were twenty-four hours in every day and seven days
in each week. Time was one thing Larry had plenty
of. Why not climb the fence and steal a long luxurious
nap in the orchard of the Elkhorn Lodge? He
looked at his watch—and ten seconds later was trespassing
with long strides through the grass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry was Irish by descent. He was five-and-twenty.
He had the digestion of an ostrich. For
which good reasons and several others he whistled
as his quirt whipped the alfalfa tops from the stems.
For the young range rider was in love with life, the
mere living. Take last night, now. He had flirted
outrageously at the Circle O T Ranch dance with
Jack Cole’s girl, though he had known she was expecting
to be married before winter. Jack was his
friend, and he had annoyed him and made him
jealous. Larry had excited Kate with the flattery
of a new conquest, and he had made the ranchers and
their wives smile tolerantly at the way he had
“rushed” her. All of this was grist to his mill. He
liked to be envied, to be admired, to be thought
irresistible. His vanity accepted it as tribute to
his attractiveness. Besides, what harm did it do?
Kate and Jack would quarrel and make up. This
would be a variation to the monotony of their courtship.
He had really done them a kindness, though
probably Jack would not recognize it as one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flinging himself down beneath a tree, he drew a
deep breath of content. Roving eyes swept the
open pasture adjoining, the blue sky with its westering
sun ready to sink behind a crotch of the hills.
His blinking lids closed sleepily, and opened again
while he nestled closer to the ground and pillowed
a dusky head on an arm. He had slept only two
hours the night before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the foliage above came a faint rustle followed
by what might pass as a discreet little cough. The
range rider sat up as though he were hinged at the
hips, rose to his feet, and lifted the pinched-in felt
hat to a glimpse of blue in the shower of blossoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did <span class='it'>you</span> come from?” he demanded, face
lifted to the foliage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From Keokuk, Iowa,” came the prompt answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed at this literal response. “I’ll never
believe it, ma’am. You’re one of these banshees
my mother used to talk about, or else you’re a fairy
or one of these here nymphs that dwell in trees.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the blossoms he made out a slim figure of
grace, vaguely outlined in the mass of efflorescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her laughter rippled down to him. “Sorry to
disappoint you, sir. But I’m a mere woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t so sure you won’t open up yore wings an’
fly away,” he protested. “But if you’re givin’ me
the straight of it, all I’ve got to say is that I like
women. I been waitin’ for one twenty-odd years.
Last night I dreamed I was gonna find her before
sunset to-day. That’s straight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was seated on a branch, chin tilted in a little
cupped fist, one heel caught on the bough below to
steady her. With an instinct wholly feminine she
dexterously arranged the skirt without being able to
conceal some inches of slender limb rising from a well-turned
ankle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll have to hasten on your way, then. The
sun sets in half an hour,” she told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His grin was genial, insinuating, an unfriendly
critic might have said impudent. “Room for argument,
ma’am,” he demurred. “Funny, ain’t it,
that of all the millions of apple trees in the world I
sat down under this one—an’ while you were in it?
Here we are, the man, the tree, an’ the girl, as you
might say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you listing the items in the order of their
importance?” she asked. “And anyhow we won’t be
here long, since I am leaving now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why are you going?” he wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little matter, a mere trifle. You seem to
have forgotten it, but—we haven’t been introduced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now looky here, ma’am. What’s in a name?
Some guys says, ‘Meet Mr. Jones,’ an’ you claim
you know me. Not a thing to that. It’s a heap
more fun to do our own introducin’. Now ain’t it?
Honest Injun! I’m anything you want to call me,
an’ you’re Miss-Lady-in-the-Apple-Blossoms. An’
now that’s been fixed, I reckon I’ll take the elevator
up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s eyes sparkled. There was something
attractive about this young fellow’s impudence that
robbed it of offence. Womanlike, her mind ran to
evasions. “You can’t come up. You’d shake down
all the blossoms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I shook ’em all down but one I’ll bet the tree
would bloom to beat any other in the orchard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that is meant for a compliment——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Lady, for the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught the lowest limb and was about to swing
himself up. Her sharp “No!” held him an instant
while their eyes met. A smile crept into his and
gave the face a roguish look, a touch of Pan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you come down then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At my convenience, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An upward swing brought him to the fork of the
tree. Yet a moment, and he was beside her among
the blossoms. Her eyes swept him in one swift
glance, curiously, a little shyly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With not even a by-your-leave. You are a
claim jumper,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am. I’m locatin’ the one adjoinin’
yores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may have mine, since I’m vacating it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now don’t you,” he protested. “Let yoreself
go once an’ be natural. Like a human being. Hear
that meadow-lark calling to his mate. He’s tellin’
his lady friend how strong he is for her. Why even
the irrigation ditch is singin’ a right nice song about
what a peach of a day it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s eyes appraised him without seeming to
do so. So far the cow-punchers she had met had been
shy and awkward, red-faced and perspiring. But
this youth was none of these. The sun and the wind
of the Rockies had painted the tan on face and neck
and hands, had chiselled tiny humorous wrinkles
that radiated from the corners of his eyes. Every
inch of the broad-rimmed felt hat, of the fancy silk
kerchief, of the decorated chaps, certified him a rider
of the range. But where had he picked up that
spirited look of gay energy, that whimsical smile
which combined deference and audacity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He travels fast,” the girl announced to the world
at large. “Which reminds me that so must I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry too made a confidant of his environment.
“I wonder how she’ll get past me—unless she really
has wings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard that all Westerners are gentlemen at
heart,” she mused aloud. “Of course he’ll let me past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now she’s tryin’ to flatter me. Nothin’ doing.
We’ll give it out right now that I’m no gentleman,”
he replied, impersonally. Then, abandoning his
communion with the apple blossoms, he put a question
to the young woman who shared the tenancy
of the tree with him: “Mind if I smoke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should you ask me, since you confess—or
do you boast?—that you are no gentleman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the pocket of his shirt he drew tobacco and
paper, then rolled a cigarette. “I’m one off an’ on,”
he explained. “Whenever it don’t cramp my style,
you understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took advantage of his preoccupation with the
“makings,” stepped lightly to a neighbouring branch,
swung to a lower one, and dropped easily to earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes that looked up at him sparkled triumph.
“I wish you luck in your search for that paragon
you’re to meet before sunset,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be lucky. Don’t you worry about that,” he
boasted coolly. “Only I don’t have to find her now.
I’ve found her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, unexpectedly, they went down into the
alfalfa together amid a shower of apple blossoms.
For he, swinging from the branch upon which he
sat, had dropped, turned his ankle on an outcropping
root, and clutched at her as he fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl merely sat down abruptly, but he plunged
cheek first into the soft loam of the plowed orchard.
His nose and the side of his face were decorated with
débris. Mopping his face with a handkerchief, he
succeeded in scattering more widely the soil he had
accumulated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him, gave a little giggle, suppressed
it decorously, then went off into a gale of laughter.
He joined her mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not that there’s anything really to laugh at,”
he presently assured her with dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman made an honest attempt at
gravity, but one look at his embellished face set her
off again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We just sat down,” he explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. On your bubble of romance. It’s gone—punctured——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, Miss Lady-in-the-Apple-Blossoms. I’m
stickin’ to my story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it won’t stick to you, as for instance the dirt
does that you grubbed into.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sho!” He mopped his face again. “You know
blame’ well we’re gonna be friends. Startin’ from
right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started to rise, but he was before her. With
both hands he drew her to her feet. She looked at
him, warily, with a little alarm, for he had not released
her hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you please,” she suggested, a warning in her
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed, triumphantly, and swiftly drew her
to him. His lips brushed her hot cheek before she
could push him away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She snatched her hands from him, glared indignantly
for an instant at him, then turned on her heel
in contemptuous silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Smilingly he watched her disappear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly, jubilation still dancing in his eyes, he
waded through the alfalfa to the fence, crept between
two strands, and mounted the patient cow pony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he rode by the ranch house the girl he had
kissed heard an unabashed voice lifted gaily in song.
The words drifted to her down the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came to her as a boast, almost as a challenge.
She recognized the voice, the jaunty impudence of
its owner. There was no need to go to the window
of her room to make sure of who the singer was.
The blood burned in her cheeks. Fire sparked in
her eyes. If he ever gave her a chance she would
put him in his place, she vowed.</p>

<h3>TIM FLANDERS OFFERS INFORMATION AND OPINIONS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>FTER dinner at the Elkhorn Lodge Ruth
Trovillion left her aunt reading an installment
of a magazine serial and drifted across
to the large log cabin which was used as a recreation
hall by guests of the “dude” ranch. At least she
appeared to drift, to hesitate before starting, and
after arriving gave an impression of being there
tentatively. The thoughts and motives of young
women are not always to be read by their manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tim Flanders, owner of the ranch, was sitting
on the porch smoking a postprandial pipe, his chair
tilted back and his feet propped against one of the
posts. At sight of Miss Trovillion, who was a favourite
of his, the legs of the chair and his feet came
to the floor simultaneously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t disturb yourself on my account, Mr.
Flanders,” she told him. “I’m not staying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might as well ’light an’ stay for a while,” he said,
and dragged a chair forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth stood for a moment, as though uncertain,
before she sat down. “Well, I will, thank you, since
you’ve taken so much trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They sat in silence, the girl looking across at the
dark blue-black line of mountains which made a
jagged outline against a sky not quite so dark. She
had not yet lived long enough among the high hills
to have got over her wonder at their various aspects
under different lights and atmospheres.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s been kinda hot to-day for this time o’ year,”
her host said at last by way of a conversational
advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she agreed. “But it will be June in a few
days. Doesn’t it begin to get warmer here then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not what you’d call real warm, ma’am. We’re
a mile high, an’ then some more on top o’ that,” he
reminded her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently, the subject of the weather having been
exhausted, Flanders offered another gambit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope, ma’am, you didn’t break any more cowboy
hearts to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned eyes of amiable scorn upon him. “Cowboys!
Where are they, these cowboys you promised
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They been kinda scarce down this way lately,
sure enough,” he admitted. “But you mighta
seen one to-day if you’d happen’ to have been lookin’
when he passed. His name is Larry Silcott.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tim’s shrewd eyes rested on her. He indulged in
mental gossipy instincts, and it happened that he
had seen Silcott come out of the orchard only a few
moments before Miss Trovillion had arrived at the
house, evidently also from the orchard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indifferently Miss Trovillion answered, her eyes
again on the distant blue-black silhouette. “Is
he the one that was claiming so loudly to be the best
cowboy in the world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, ma’am. Larry’s liable to claim anything.
He’s that-a-way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what do you mean by that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s got his nerve, Larry has.” He chuckled.
“Last night, for instance, by what the boys say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was a dance at the Circle O T. I reckon
Larry was pretty scand’lous the way he shined up
to another fellow’s girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose he’s one of the kind that thinks he’s
irresistible,” she said, an edge of contempt in her
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he has got notions along that line. Probably
he’s got some basis for them too. Larry is the
sort women like, I judge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sort is that?” she wanted to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They like a fellow who is gay an’ puts up a good
bluff, one who has lots of little laughin’ secrets to
whisper to ’em behind his hand when other folks are
in the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to know all about it, Mr. Flanders.
Why don’t you write a book about us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He refused to be daunted by her sarcasm. “I
notice what I notice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I suppose this Mr. Silcott is really what they
call a four-flusher?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, no, he ain’t. In his way Larry is a top
hand. I ain’t right keen on his way, but that’s a
matter of opinion. He’s mighty popular, an’ he
delivers the goods. None of the boys can ride a
buckin’ bronco with him, onless it’s Rowan McCoy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And who’s he? Another poser?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flanders’ answer came instantly and emphatically.
“No, <span class='it'>ma’am</span>. He’s a genuwine dyed-in-the-wool
he-man, Rowan is. If you want to see a real Westerner,
one of the best of the breed, why, Rowan
McCoy is yore man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes—and where is he on exhibit?” she asked
lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a cattleman. Owns the Circle Diamond
Ranch—not so gosh awful far from here. I’ll ride
over with you some day when I get time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth knew he would never find time. Tim was
temperamentally indolent. He could work hard
when he once got his big body into action. But it
took a charge of dynamite to start him. His promises
were made in good faith, but he often did not
quite get round to fulfilling them. He was always
suggesting some place of interest she ought to see
and offering to take her there some day. This suited
Ruth well enough. She could always organize at
any time a party for a day’s horseback trip among
the guests of the “dude” ranch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl referred again to her pretended grievance.
“You’re a false alarm, Mr. Flanders, and I’m going
to sue you for breach of contract. You promised
me the second day we were here—you know you did—to
round up a likely bunch of cow-punchers for me
to study. We dudes don’t come out here just for
the scenery, you know. We want all the local colour
there is. It’s your business to supply it. I suppose
it isn’t reasonable to ask for Indian raids any more,
or hold-ups, or anything of that sort. But the least
you can do is to supply us a few picturesque cowboys,
even if you have to send to the moving-picture people
to get them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Say, Miss Trovillion, I’ve been readin’ about
these new moving pictures. Last time I was in
Denver I went to see one. It’s great. Of course I
reckon it’s only a fad, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re dodging the issue, Mr. Flanders. Are
you going to make good on those cowboys or aren’t
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The owner of the Elkhorn Lodge scratched his gray
poll. “Sure I am. Right now most of the boys
are busy up in the hills, but they’ll be driftin’ down
soon. Say, I’m sure thick-haided. I’d ought to
have taken you to that Circle O T dance last night.
I expect Mrs. Flanders would have gone if I’d mentioned
it. You would have seen plenty of the boys
there. But one of these days there will be another
dance. And say, ma’am, there’s Round-up Week
at Bad Ax pretty soon. They’ll come ridin’ in for
a hundred miles for that, every last one of these lads
that throw a rope. That’s one real <span class='it'>rodeo</span>—ropin’,
ridin’, bull-doggin’, pony races, Indian dances,
anything you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will they let a tenderfoot attend?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s what it’s for, to grab off the tenderfoot’s
dough. But honest, it’s a good show. You’ll like
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll certainly be there, if Aunt is well enough,”
Ruth announced with decision.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch3'>CHAPTER III</h1></div>

<h3>A CHALLENGE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE road meandered over and through brown
Wyoming in the line of least resistance. It
would no doubt reach the Fryingpan some
time and ultimately Wagon Wheel, but the original
surveyors of the trail were leisurely in their habits.
They had chewed the bovine cud and circled hills
with a saving instinct that wasted no effort. The
ranchman of the Hill Creek district had taken the
wise hint of their cattle. They, too, were in no haste
and preferred to detour rather than climb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Rowan McCoy was in any hurry he gave no
sign of it. He let his horse fall into a slow walk of
its own choice. The problem of an overstocked
range was worrying him. Sheep had come bleating
across the bad lands to steal the grass from the cattle,
regardless of priority of occupancy. It was a question
that touched McCoy and his neighbours nearly.
They had seen their stock pushed back from one
feeding ground after another by herds of woolly invaders.
Rowan could name a dozen cattlemen
within as many miles who were face to face with ruin.
All of them had well-stocked ranches, were heavily
in debt, yet stood to make a good thing if they could
hold the range even for two years longer. The price
of a cattle had begun to go up and was due for a big
rise. The point was whether they could hang on
long enough to take advantage of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sweeping curve the road swung to the rim
of a saucer-shaped valley and dipped abruptly over
the brow—a white ribbon zigzagging across the
tender spring green of the mountain park. Bovier’s
Camp the place was still called, but the Frenchman
who had first set up a cabin here had been dead
twenty years. The camp was a trading centre for
thirty miles, though there was nothing to it but a
blacksmith shop, a doctor’s office with bachelor’s
quarters attached, a stage station, a general store
and post office, and the houses of the Pin and Feather
Ranch. Yet cow-punchers rode a day’s journey
to get their “air-tights” and their tobacco here and
to lounge away an idle hour in gossip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man was swinging from his saddle just as McCoy
rode up to the store. He was a big, loose-jointed
fellow, hook-nosed, sullen of eye and mouth. His
hard gaze met the glance of the cattleman with jeering
hostility, but he offered no greeting before he
turned away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two or three cow-punchers and a ranch owner
were in the store. The hook-nosed man exchanged
curt nods with them and went directly to the post office
cage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any mail for J. C. Tait?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The postmistress handed him a letter and two
circulars from liquor houses. She was an angular
woman, plain, middle-aged, severe of feature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s Norma?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothin’ the matter with her far as I know,”
answered Tait sulkily. His manner gave the impression
that he resented her question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shout of welcome met McCoy as he appeared
in the doorway. It was plain that he was in the
good books of those present as much as Tait was the
opposite. For Rowan McCoy, owner of the Circle
Diamond Ranch, was the leader of the cattle interests
in this neighbourhood, and big Joe Tait was
the most aggressive and the most bitter of the sheepmen
fighting for the range.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bovier’s Camp was in the heart of the cattle
country, but Tait made no concession to the fact
that he was unwelcome here. He leaned against
the counter, a revolver in its holster lying along his
thigh. There was something sinister and deadly
in the sneer with which he returned the coldness of
the men he was facing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced over the liquor circulars before he
ripped open the envelope of the letter. His black
eyes, set in deep sockets, began to blaze. The red
veined cheeks of his beefy face darkened to an apoplectic
purple. Joe Tait enraged was not a pleasant
object to see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He flung a sudden profane defiance at them all.
“You’re a fine bunch of four-flushers. It’s about
your size to send a skull-and-crossbones threat
through the mail, but I notice you haven’t the guts
to sign it. I’m not to cross the bad lands, eh?
I’m to keep on the other side of the dead line you’ve
drawn. And if I don’t you warn me I’ll get into
trouble. To hell with your warning!” Tait crumpled
the letter in his sinewy fist, flung it down, spat
tobacco juice on it, and ground it savagely under his
heel. “That’s what I think of your warning, McCoy.
Trouble! Me, I eat trouble. If you or any
of your bunch of false alarms want any you can have
it right now and here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy, sitting on a nail keg, had been talking
with one of his friends. He did not move. There
was a moment’s chill silence. Every man present
knew that Tait was ready to back his challenge.
He might be a bully, but nobody doubted his gameness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not looking for trouble,” the cattleman said
coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you weren’t,” jeered Tait. “You
never have been, far as I can make out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood mounted to McCoy’s face. Nobody
in the room could miss the point of that last taunt.
It was common knowledge in the Hill Creek country
that years before Norma Davis had jilted him
to run away with Joe Tait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon you’ve said enough,” suggested Falkner,
the range rider to whom Rowan had been talking.
“And enough is aplenty, Joe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do I have to get your say-so before I can talk,
Falkner? I’ll say to you, too, what I’m saying to
the man beside you. There can’t any of you—no,
nor all of you—run me out the way you did Pap
Thomson. Try anything like that, and you’ll find
me lying right in the door of my sheep wagon with
hell popping. Hear that, McCoy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I hear you.” McCoy looked at him hard.
One could have gathered no impression of weakness
from the lean brown face of the cattleman. The
blue-gray eyes were direct and steely. Power lay
in the packed muscles of the stocky frame. Confidence
rested in the set of the broad shoulders and
the poise of the close-cropped head. “I didn’t write
that letter to you, and I don’t know who did. But
I’ll give you a piece of advice. Keep your sheep on
the other side of the dead line. They’ll maybe live
longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheepman shook a fist at him furiously.
“That’s a threat, McCoy. Don’t you back it.
Don’t you dare lift a finger to my sheep. I’ll run
them where I please. I’ll bring ’em right up to the
door of the Circle Diamond, too, if it suits me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A young ranchman lounging in the doorway cut
into the talk. “I reckon you can bring ’em there,
Joe, but I ain’t so sure you could take ’em away
again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who’d stop me?” demanded Tait, whirling on
him. “Would it be you, Jack Cole?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might be there, and I might not. You never
can tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tait took a step toward him. The undisciplined
temper of the man was boiling up. He had for nearly
two days been drinking heavily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Might as well settle this now—the sooner the
quicker,” he said thickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sharply McCoy spoke: “We’re none of us armed,
Tait. Don’t make a mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheep owner threw his revolver on the counter.
“I don’t need any gun to settle any business I’ve
got with Jack Cole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you start anything here, Joe Tait,” ordered
the postmistress in a shrill voice. She ran
out from her cage and confronted the big man indomitably.
“You can’t bully <span class='it'>me</span>. I’m the United
States Government when I’m in this room. Don’t
you forget it, either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A shadow darkened the doorway, and a young
woman came into the store. She stopped, surprised,
aware that she had interrupted a scene. Her soft
dark eyes passed from one to another, asking information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an awkward silence. The sheepman
turned with a half-suppressed oath, snatched up his
weapon, thrust it into the holster, and strode from
the room. Yet a moment, and the thudding of
hoofs could be heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The postmistress turned in explanation to the
girl. “It’s Joe Tait. He’s always trying to raise
a rookus, that man is. But he can’t bully me, no
matter how bad an actor he is. I’m not his wife.”
She walked around the counter and resumed a dry
manner of business. “Do you want all the mail for
the Elkhorn Lodge or just your own?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take it all, Mrs. Stovall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman handed through the cage opening
a canvas bag, into which papers and letters were
stuffed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three letters for you, Miss Trovillion,” the older
woman said, sliding them across to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re good to me to-day.” The girl thanked
her with a quick smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I notice I’m good to you most days,” Mrs.
Stovall replied with friendly sarcasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth Trovillion buckled the mail bag and turned
to go. As she walked out of the store her glance
flashed curiously over the men. It lingered for a
scarcely perceptible instant on McCoy.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='ch4'>CHAPTER IV</h1></div>

<h3>INTRODUCING ROWAN McCOY TO RUTH TROVILLION</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>M</span>cCOY followed a road that led from Bovier’s
Camp into the hills. He was annoyed at
the altercation with Tait that had flared
up in the store. Between the sheep and cattle interests
on the Fryingpan there had been a good deal
of bickering and recrimination, some night raiding,
an occasional interchange of shots. But for the most
part there had been so far at least a decent pretense
of respect for the law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except for Tait a compromise settlement might
have been effected. But the big sheepman was not
reasonable. Originally a cattleman himself, he had
quarrelled violently with all of his range neighbours,
and at last gone into sheep out of spite. There was
no give-and-take about him. The policy of live and
let live did not commend itself to his turbulent temper.
What he wanted he intended to take with a
high hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were personal reasons why McCoy desired
no trouble with him. Rowan had not seen Norma
half a dozen times since she had run away with Tait
in anger after a quarrel between the lovers. If she
regretted her folly, no word to that effect had ever
reached McCoy or any other outsider. On the few
occasions when she came out into her little neighbourhood
world it was with a head still high. Without
impertinence, one could do no more than guess at her
unhappiness. Upon one thing her former lover was
determined: there would be no trouble of his making
between him and the man Norma had chosen for a
husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cattleman turned up a cañon, followed it to
its head, cut across the hills, and descended into the
valley of the Fryingpan. The river was high from
the spring thaw of the mountain snows. Below
him he could see its swirling waters tumbling down
in agitated hurry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the road in front of him a trap was moving
toward the stream. He recognized the straight
back of the slim driver as that of the girl he had seen
at the post office. Evidently she was taking the cut-off
back to the ranch, unaware that the bridge had
been washed out by the freshet. Would she turn
back or would she try the ford just below the bridge?
He touched his horse with the spur and put it to
a canter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl drew up and viewed the remains of the
bridge, then turned to the ford. Presently she drove
slowly down to its edge. After a moment’s apparent
hesitation she forced the reluctant horse to take the
water. As the wheels sank deeper, as the turbid
current swept above the axles and into the bed of the
trap, the heart of the young woman failed. She
gave a little cry of alarm and tried to turn back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man galloping toward the ford shouted a
warning: “Keep going! Swing to the right!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is likely the driver did not hear his call. She
tried to cramp to the left. The horse, frightened,
plunged forward into the deep pool below the ford.
The force of the stream swept horse and rig down.
The girl screamed and started to rise, appalled by the
whirling torrent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miraculously, a horse and rider appeared beside
her. She was lifted bodily from the trap to the arms
of a rescuer. For a few moments the cow pony
struggled with the waters. It fought hard for a
footing, splashed into the shallows nearer shore, and
emerged safely at the farther bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found herself lifted to the ground and deserted.
The Heaven-sent horseman unfastened the rope at
his saddle, swung it round his head, and dropped a
large loop over the back of the trap. The other end
he tied to the pommel of the saddle. The cow pony
obeyed orders, braced its legs, and began to pull.
The owner of the animal did not wait for results,
but waded deep into the river and seized the bridle
of the exhausted buggy horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even then it was a near thing. The Fryingpan
fought with a heavy plunging suction to keep its
prey. The man and the horses could barely hold
their own, far less make headway against the current.
As to the girl, she watched the battle with big, fascinated
eyes, the blood driven from her heart by
terror. Soon it flashed across her brain that these
three creatures of flesh and blood could not win, for
while they wore out their strength in vain the cruel
river pounded down on them with undiminished
energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flew to the rope and pulled, digging her heels
into the sand for a better purchase. After what
seemed to her a long time, almost imperceptibly, at
first by fitful starts, the rope moved. McCoy
inched his way to the shallower water and a more
secure footing. Man, horse, and trap came jerkily
to land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost exhausted, the cattleman staggered to his
bronco and leaned against its heaving flanks. His
eyes met those of the girl. Her tremulous lips were
ashen. He guessed that she was keeping a tight
rein on a hysterical urge to collapse into tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all right,” he said, and she liked the pleasant
smile that went with the words. “We’re all safe
now. No harm done. None a-tall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought—I was afraid——” She caught her
lip between her white teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. Anybody would be. You oughtn’t to
have tried the ford. There should be a sign up there.
I’ll get after the road commissioners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth knew he was talking to give her time to
recover composure. He went on, casually and
cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Fryingpan is mighty deceiving. When she’s
in flood she certainly tears along in a hurry. More
than one cow-puncher has been drowned in her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She managed a smile. “I’ve been complaining
because I couldn’t find an adventure. This was a
little too serious. I thought, one time, that—that
you might not get out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you pulled me out. That was fine. I won’t
forget it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked at the blisters on her soft palms,
and again a faint little smile twitched at her face.
“Neither shall I for a day or two. I have souvenirs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He began to arrange the disordered harness, rebuckling
a strap here and pulling the leather into
place there. Dark eyes under long, curved lashes
observed him as he moved, lean-loined and broad of
shoulder, the bronze of the eternal outdoors burned
into his hands and neck and lean face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My name is Trovillion; Ruth Trovillion,” she
said shyly. “I’m staying at Elkhorn Lodge, or the
Dude Ranch, as you people call it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook hands without embarrassment. “My
name is Rowan McCoy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Level eyes, with the blue of Western skies in them,
looked straight into hers. A little wave of emotion
beat through her veins. She knew, warned by the
sure instinct of her sex, that this man who had torn
her from the hands of death was to be no stranger in
her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I saw you at the store to-day. And I’ve
heard of you, from Mr. Flanders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She abandoned that avenue of approach, and came
to a more personal one—came to it with a face of
marble except for the live eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But for you I would have drowned,” she said,
and shuddered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe so; maybe not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I couldn’t have got out alone,” she insisted.
“Of course I can’t thank you. There’s no
use trying. But I’ll never forget—never as long as
I live.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>About her there was a proud, delicate beauty that
charmed him. She was at once so slender and so
vital. Her face was like a fine, exquisitely cut cameo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” he agreed cheerfully. “Honours
are easy then, Miss Trovillion. I lifted you out and
you pulled me out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you can <span class='it'>say</span> that! As if I did anything that
counted.” The fount of her feelings had been
touched, and she was still tremulous. It was impossible
for her to dismiss this adventure as casually
as he seemed ready to do. After all, it had been the
most tremendous hazard of her young, well-sheltered
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had made sure the trap was fit for the
road, McCoy turned to his companion and helped
her in. She drove slowly. The cattleman rode beside
her. He was going out of his way, but he found
for himself a sufficient excuse. She was a slim slip
of a girl who had lived her nineteen or twenty years
in cities far from the primitive dangers of the wild.
Probably she was unstrung from her experience and
might collapse. Anyhow, he was not going to take
the chance of it.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='ch5'>CHAPTER V</h1></div>

<h3>A RIDE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>TILL at the age when she was frankly the
centre of her own universe, Ruth Trovillion
had an abundant sense of romance. There
was no intention in her decided young mind of treading
a road worn dusty by the feet of the commonplace.
On occasion a fine rapture filled her hours.
She was still reacting to the ecstatic shock of youth’s
early-morning plunge into the wonderful river of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan McCoy had impressed himself upon her
imagination. He had not come into her life with
jingling spurs, garnished like Larry Silcott with all
the picturesque trimmings of the frontier. Larry
was too free, too fresh, she thought. But McCoy,
quiet, competent son of the hard-riding West, depended
on no adventitious aid of costume. He was
as indigenous and genuine as one of his own hill
cattle. Ruth had admirers in plenty, but they
dwindled to non-heroic proportions before his brown
virility, his gentle, reticent strength.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quietly she gathered information about him. The
owner of the Circle Diamond was a leader in the
community by grace of natural fitness. Tim Flanders,
who kept the Elkhorn Lodge, summed him up
for Ruth in two sentences:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s a straight-up rider, Mac is. He’ll do to
take along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean by that?” asked his young
guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can tie to him. He’ll go through. There’s
no yellow in Rowan McCoy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought over that a good deal. Her judgment
concurred. So far as it went, the verdict of Flanders
was sound. But it did not go far enough. During
the ride to the ranch she had discovered that the
cattleman had a capacity for silence. Ruth found
herself fascinated by the desire to push through to
the personality behind the wall of reserve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For some time she was given no chance. It was
ten days after the rescue before she saw him again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went on her way with what patience she could,
enjoying the activities of the “dude” ranch. She
rode, fished, and picnicked in the hills with the other
guests. Two days were spent in climbing Big Twin
Peak. In the evenings she read to her aunt while
that lady indefatigably knitted. The surface of her
mind was absorbed by the details of the life arranged
for her. McCoy was not on the horizon of her movements,
but he was very much in the map of her
thoughts. She did not hear his name mentioned.
To these well-to-do people from the East spending
a pleasant vacation in Wyoming he did not exist.
But it was impossible for Ruth to get this quiet,
steady-eyed man out of her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why did he not come to see her? Yet, even as
she asked herself the question, Ruth found an adequate
answer. She had very little vanity. Probably
she had not interested him. There was no real
reason why he should call unless he wanted to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then one day, unexpectedly, she met him on a
hill trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why haven’t you been to see me?” she asked,
with the directness that characterized her at times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet she quaked at her own audacity. He might
think even though he would be too courteous to say
so, that he did not care to waste the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He thought a moment before he committed himself
to words. He had wanted to come, but he had
passed through an experience which made him very
reserved with women. He never called on any, nor
did he go to dances or merrymakings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been pretty busy, Miss Trovillion,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s no excuse. I might have got pneumonia
from wet feet or gone into a nervous breakdown from
the shock. You’ve got no right to pull a girl out of
the river and then ride away and forget she ever
existed. It’s not good form. They are not doing
it this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed at the jaunty impudence of her tilted
chin. Somehow she reminded him of a young,
singing meadow-lark experimenting with its wings.
He suspected shyness back of her audacity. Yet
he was surprised at his own answer when he heard it;
at least he was surprised at the impulse which had
led him to make it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I haven’t forgotten you. I’ll be glad to
come to see you, if I may.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will this evening do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be looking for you, Mr. McCoy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cattleman told the simple truth when he said
that he had not forgotten her. The girl had been
very much in his mind ever since he had left her at
the gate of the Lodge. He loved all young, clean
life even among animals, and she seemed to him the
embodied youth of the world, free and light-footed
as a fawn in the misty break of day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When McCoy reached Elkhorn Lodge after dinner
Ruth introduced him to her aunt, a thin, flat-bosomed
spinster with the marks of ill health on her face.
Miss Morgan and her niece had come to the Rockies
for the health of the older woman, and were scheduled
to make an indefinite stay. Before the cattleman
had talked with her five minutes he knew that Miss
Morgan viewed life from a narrow, Puritanic standpoint.
He guessed that there was little real sympathy
between her and the vivid girl by her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her early years Ruth had been a lonely, repressed
little soul. An orphaned child, she had been
brought up by this maiden lady, who looked on the
leggy, helter-skelter youngster with the tangled
flying hair as a burden laid upon her by the Lord.
Ruth had been a lawless, wilful little thing, naughty
and painfully plain by the standard of her aunt; a
difficult little girl to train in the way she should go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surprisingly she had blossomed from the ugly-duckling
stage into a most attractive girl. Nobody
had been more amazed at the transformation than her
aunt. The change was not merely external. The
manner of Ruth had become gentler, less wilful. As a
nurse she had developed patience toward the invalid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mind if Mr. McCoy and I ride out to Flat
Top for the sunset?” she asked now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, child. I’ll be all right. But don’t stay
late,” Miss Morgan assented a little fretfully. It
was one of Ruth’s ways to become absorbed in the
interest of the moment to forgetfulness of everything
else. This was one of the penalties her friends paid
for her vivid enthusiasms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The riders passed a poster tacked to a tree just
outside the gates of the ranch. It bore this legend:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth drew up to read it. She turned to her
companion. “You’ll ride, I suppose? Mr. Flanders
says you’re a famous bronco buster.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t reckon I will,” he answered. “Some
of the boys entered me, but I’ve decided not to go in
this year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gettin’ too old to be jolted around so rough,”
he replied, smiling. “The younger lads can take
their turn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, you look as though you had one foot in the
grave,” she derided, with a swift glance at the muscular
shoulders above the long, lean body. “Of
course you’ll ride. You’ve got to. Aren’t you
champion of the world?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just a way of talkin’,” he explained.
“They have one of these shows each year at Cheyenne.
Other places have ’em too. The winners
can’t all be champions of the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I want to see you ride,” she told him, as
though he could not without discourtesy refuse so
small a favour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He dismissed this with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Flat Top they watched the sun go down behind
a sea of rounded hills. The flame of it was in
her blood, the glow of it on her face. She was in love
with Wyoming these days, with the cool and crystalline
air of its mornings, with the scarfs of heat waving
across the desert at noon, with the porphyry mountain
peaks edged with fire at even. There was this
much of the poet in Ruth Trovillion, that she could
go out at dewy dawn and find a miracle in the sunrise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impulsively she turned to her companion a face
luminous with joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you just love it all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. The picture struck a spark from his
imagination. By some trick of light and shade she
seemed the heart of the sunset, a golden, glowing
creature of soft, warm flesh through which an ardent
soul quivered and palpitated with vague yearnings
and inarticulate desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the perfect peace of a harmonious world
jarred a raucous shout. From a hill pocket back of
Flat Top came a cloud of dust. In the falling
light a dim, gray mass poured out upon the mesa.
It moved with a soft rustle of small, padded feet, of
wool fleeces rubbing against each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A horseman cantered into view and caught sight
of McCoy. With a jeering laugh he shouted a
greeting:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine sheep weather these days, McCoy. How
about cows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of the cattleman blazed. The girl
noticed the swift flush under the tan of the cheeks,
the lips that closed like a steel trap. It was plain
that the man rode himself with a strong rein.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m still waiting in the door of my sheep wagon
for you and your friends,” scoffed the drunken voice.
“And my wagon is a whole lot nearer the Circle
Diamond than it was. One of these days I’ll drive
up to your door like I promised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still McCoy said nothing, but the muscles stood
out on his clamped jaws like ropes. The sheepman
rode closer, turned insolent eyes on the girl. From
his ribald, hateful mirth she shrank back with a sense
of degradation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tait turned his horse and galloped away. He
shouted an order to a herder. A dog passed silently
in and out of the gray mass, which moved across the
mesa like an agitated wave of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl asked a question: “Has he crossed the
dead line?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” Then: “What do you know about the
dead line?” asked her companion, surprised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I have eyes and ears.” She put herself
swiftly on his side. “I think you’re right. He’s
bad—hateful. Your cattle were here first. He
brought sheep in to spite you and his other neighbours.
Isn’t that true?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy wondered how much more this uncannily
shrewd young person knew about the relations between
him and Tait. Did she know, for instance,
the story of how Norma Davis had jilted him to
marry the sheepman?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What will you do? Will you fight for the range?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” This was a subject the cattleman could
not discuss. He dismissed it promptly. “Hadn’t
we better be moving toward the ranch, Miss Trovillion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode back together in the gathering dusk.</p>

<h3>CHAMPION OF THE WORLD</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>“L</span>ARRY SILCOTT on Rocking Chair,” boomed
a deep voice through a megaphone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A girl in one of the front boxes of the grand
stand saw a young cow-puncher move with jingling
spurs across the wide race track toward the corral
beyond. He looked up, easy and debonair as an
actor, and raked with his eyes the big crowd watching
him. Smile met smile, when his glance came to
halt at the eager girl looking down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth Trovillion’s smile went out like the flame
of a blown candle. She had not caught the name
announced through the megaphone, but now she
recognized him. The last time she had seen this
gay youth, now sunning himself so jauntily in the
public regard, had been in the orchard of Elkhorn
Lodge; he had kissed her impudently, and when their
eyes had met hers had flashed hatred at him for the
affront he had dared to put upon her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned away, flaming, chin in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he a good rider?” she asked the man sitting
beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wyoming doesn’t raise better riders than Larry
Silcott,” he answered promptly. “He’s an A-1 rider—the
best of the lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You beat him last year, didn’t you?” she challenged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy did not quite understand her imperious
resentment. It seemed to go a little farther than the
occasion called for. “That was the luck of the day.
I happened——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, you happened!” scoffed Ruth. “You
could go out and beat him now if you wanted to.
Why don’t you ride? Your name is entered. I
should think you would defend your championship.
Everybody wants to see last year’s winner ride. I
haven’t any patience with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan smiled. “I see you haven’t, Miss Ruth.
I’ve tried to explain. I like Larry. We’re friends.
Besides, I taught him his riding. Looks to me as
if it is one of the younger fellow’s turn. Now is a
good time for me to quit after I have won two years
running.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman was not convinced, but she
dropped the argument. Her resentful eyes moved
back to the arena, into which a meek-looking claybank
had been driven. It stood with blinking eyes,
drooping at the hip, palpably uninterested in the
proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of a sudden the ears of the bronco pricked, its
eyes dilated. A man in chaps was moving toward
it, a rope in his hands. The loop of the lariat circled,
went whistling forward, fell true over the head of
the outlaw horse. The claybank reared, tried to
bolt, came strangling to a halt as the loop tightened.
A second rope slid into place beside the first. The
horse stood trembling while a third man coaxed a
blanket over its eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Warily and deftly Silcott saddled, looking well to
the cinch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All ready,” he told his assistants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ropes and blanket were whipped off as he swung
to the seat. Rocking Chair stood motionless for a
moment, bewildered at the things happening so
fast. Then the outlaw realized that a human clothespin
was straddling its back. It went whirling upward
as if trying to tie itself into a knot. The rider
clamped his knees against the sides of the bronco and
swung his hat with a joyous whoop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rocking Chair had a reputation to live up to.
It was a noted fence rower, weaver, and sunfisher.
Savagely it whirled, went up in another buck, came
down stiff-legged, with arched back. The jolt was
like that of a pile driver, but Silcott met it with limp
spine, his hat still fanning against the flank of the
animal. The outlaw went round and round in a
vicious circle. The incubus was still astride of its
back. It bolted; jarred to a sudden, sideways halt.
Spurs were rowelling its sides cruelly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up again it went in a series of furious bucks, one
after another, short, sharp, violent. Meanwhile,
Silcott, who was a trick rider, went through his little
performance. He drank a bottle of ginger ale and
flung away the bottle. He took the rein between his
teeth and slipped off coat and waistcoat. He rode
with his feet out of the stirrups. The grand stand
clamoured wild applause. The young cattleman
from the Open A N C was easily the hero of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The outlaw horse stopped bucking as suddenly as
it had begun. Larry slipped from the saddle in
front of the grand stand and stood bowing, a lithe,
graceful young figure of supple ease, to the plaudits
which rained upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Abruptly Ruth turned to McCoy. “I want you
to ride,” she told him in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cattleman hesitated. He did not want to
ride. Without saying so in words, he had let the
other competitors understand that he did not mean
to defend his title. There had been a good deal of
pressure to induce him to drag a saddle into the
arena but so far he had resisted it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to decline, but the words died on his
lips. The eyes of the girl were stormy; her cheeks
flushed. It was plain that for some reason she had
set her heart on his winning. Why? His pulses
crashed with the swift, tumultuous beating of the
red blood in him. Rowan McCoy was not a vain
man. It was hard for him to accept the conclusion
for which his whole soul longed. But what other
reason could there be for her insistence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the past few weeks he had been with Ruth
Trovillion a great deal. He had ridden with her,
climbed Old Baldy by her side, eaten picnic lunches
as her companion far up in flower-strewn mountain
parks. He had taught her to shoot, to fish, to make
camp. They had been gay and wholesome comrades
for long summer days. The new and secret
thing that had come into his life he had hidden from
her as if it had been a sin. The desire of his heart
was impossible, he had always told himself. How
could it be otherwise? This fine, spirited young
creature, upon whom was stamped so ineradicably
the look of the thoroughbred, would go back to her
own kind when the time came. Meanwhile, let him
make the best of his little day of sunshine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I told the boys I wasn’t expecting to ride,” he
parried. “It has been rather understood that I
wouldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But if I ask you?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no resisting that low, imperious appeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked straight into her eyes. “If you ask it,
I’ll ride.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do ask it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose. “It’s your say-so, little partner. I’ll
let the committee know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of the girl followed him, a brown, sun-baked
man, quiet and strong and resolute. Her
glance questioned shyly what manner of man this
was, after all, who had imposed himself so greatly
upon her thoughts. He was genuine. So much she
knew. He did not need the gay trappings of Larry
Silcott to brand him a rider of the hills, foursquare
to every wind that blew. Behind the curtain of his
reticence she had divined some vague hint of a woman
in his life. Now a queer little thrill of jealousy,
savage and primeval, claimed her for the first time.
She knew her own power over Rowan McCoy. It
hurt her to feel that another girl had once possessed
it, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cow-puncher from Laramie, in yellow wool chaps
and a shirt of robin’s-egg blue, took the stage after
Silcott. He drew a roan with a red-hot devil of
malice in its eye. The bronco hunched itself over
to the fence in a series of jarring bucks, and jammed
the leg of the rider against a post. The Laramie
youth, beside himself with pain, caught at the saddle
horn to save his seat. The nearest judge fired a
revolver to tell him he was out of the running. He
had “touched leather.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His successor took the dust ignominiously in a
clean tumble. He got up, looked ruefully at the
bronco that had unseated him, and went his bowlegged
way back to meet the derisive condolences of
forty grinning punchers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad the judges didn’t have the ground
plowed up for you, Shorty. It would ’a’ been a
heap softer,” murmured one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I’d only remembered to ride on my spurs like
you done, Wade, I needn’t have fallen at all,” came
back Shorty with genial malice at his tormentor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereat the laugh was on Wade, who had been
detected earlier in the day digging his spurs into the
cinch to help him stick to the saddle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rowan McCoy on Tenderfoot,” announced the
leather-lunged megaphone man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wave of interest swept through the grand stand.
Everybody had wanted to see the champion ride.
Now they were going to get the chance. The announcement
caused a stir even among the hard-bitten
riders at the entrance to the corral. For
McCoy was not only a famous bronco buster; he was
a man whose personality had won him many friends
and some enemies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The owner of the Circle Diamond rode like a centaur.
He tried no tricks, no fancy business to win
the applause of the spectators. But he held his seat
with such ease and mastery that his long, lithe body
might have been a part of the horse. His riding was
characteristic of him—straight and strong and
genuine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The outlaw tried its wicked best, and no bronco
in the Rockies was better known than Tenderfoot
for the fighting devil that slumbered in its heart.
Neither side bucking nor pitching, sunfishing nor
weaving could shake the lean-loined, broad-shouldered
figure from his seat. It was not merely
that McCoy could not be unseated; there was never
a moment when there was any doubt of whether
man or beast was master. Even when the bronco
flung itself backward, McCoy was in the saddle
again before the animal was on its feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of Ruth never left the fighting pair.
She leaned forward, fascinated, lost to everything
in the world but the duel that was being fought out
in front of her. They were a splendid pair of animals,
each keyed to the highest notch of efficiency.
But the one in the saddle was something more. His
perfect poise was no doubt instinctive, born of long
experience. His skill had become automatic. Yet
back of this she sensed mind, a will that flashed
along the reins to the brute beneath. Slowly Tenderfoot
answered to its master, acknowledged the dominion
of the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its pitching became less violent, its bucking halfhearted.
At a signal from one of the judges, McCoy
slipped from the saddle. Without an instant’s delay,
without a single glance at the storm-tossed grand
stand, the rider strode across the arena and disappeared.
He did not know that Ruth Trovillion
was beating her gloved hands excitedly along with
five thousand other cheering spectators. He could
not guess how her heart had stood still when the
bronco toppled backward, nor how it had raced
when his toes found again the stirrups as the horse
struggled to its feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The judges conferred for a few minutes before
the megaphone man announced that the championship
belt went to McCoy, second prize to Silcott.
Once more the grand stand gave itself to eager applause
of the decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before the wild-horse race, which was the last
event on the program, McCoy made his way to the
box where Miss Trovillion was sitting with Tim
Flanders, of the Elkhorn Lodge, and his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl looked up, her eyes shining. “Congratulations,
Mr. Champion of the World.” She felt
after a fashion that she had helped to beat the conceited
Silcott, the youth who had affronted her
with his presumptuous kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was lucky,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were the best rider.” Then, with a little
touch of feminine ferocity: “I knew you would beat
<span class='it'>him</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Silcott? I still think I was lucky.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already the grand stand was beginning to empty.
Round-up Week was almost over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d better be getting back to town if we want
any supper,” proposed Flanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same idea had suggested itself to several
thousand more visitors to Bad Ax. A throng of
automobiles was presently creeping toward the gates,
every engine racing and every horn squawking.
Once outside, the whole plain seemed alive with
moving cars, buckboards, wagons, and horses all
going swiftly townward in a mad race for hotels and
restaurants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bad Ax was crowded to its suburbs. Hotels were
jammed, rooming houses doing a capacity business.
A steady stream of automobiles had poured in all
week from Denver and other points. Trains loaded
to the vestibules had emptied themselves into the
town. The bells of saloon cash registers were ringing
continuously. Cow-punchers from Sheridan and
Cody jostled shoulders with tourists from New
Haven and Kansas City, their worn leathers and
faded gray shirts discarded for gaudy costumes that
ran the rainbow from sunset orange to violent shades
of blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole town was a welter of barbaric colour.
Streamers stretched across from building to building,
and “spielers” for side shows bawled the merits
of their attraction. Everywhere one met the loud
gaiety of youth on a frolic. Young as the night was,
merrymakers were surging up and down the streets
tossing confetti and blowing horns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the crowded streets, after they had found something
to eat in a vacant store where the ladies of the
Baptist church were serving a supper, McCoy and
Miss Trovillion became separated from their friends.
Hours later they wandered from the crowd toward
the suburb where the young woman and the Flanders
family had found rooms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unaccountably their animation ebbed when they
were alone under the stars. They had been full of
laughter and small talk so long as the crowd jostled
them. Now they could find neither. In every fibre
of him Rowan was aware of the slight, dainty figure
moving by his side so lightly. The delicate, penetrating
fragrance of her personality came to him with
poignant sweetness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once his hand crept out and touched her white
gown in the darkness. If she knew, she gave no sign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes were on the hills which rose sheer back
of the town high into the sky line. They seemed to
press in closely and to lift her vision to the heavens,
to shut out all the little commonplace things of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose God made them to wash sin
out of the hearts of people?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A night like this does give a fellow queer feelings,”
he answered in a low voice. “Have you ever camped
in the high hills with the wind blowin’ kinda soft
through the pines? I have, alone, often. Makes
a fellow feel as though he’d like to begin again with a
clean page.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded. “Yes. I’ve felt it, too, though I
never camped alone of course. As though something
fine and wonderful and all-powerful was whispering
to me and drawing me nearer to eternal things. It
must be something in ourselves, don’t you think?
It can’t be that the mountains at night are really
a kind of Holy of Holies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon,” he agreed. He had never before
tried or heard anybody else try to put into words the
strange influence of the shadowy range at night upon
one camped in the hollow of a draw, an influence
which at the same time seemed to reduce one to an
atom in an ocean of space and to lift one into the
heights of the everlasting verities. He was shy of
any expression of his emotions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They fell into silence, and presently she turned
reluctantly back toward the town. He fell into step
beside her. Soon now, he knew, they would be
caught again into the spirit of the commonplace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he spoke, abruptly, to hold in his heart some
permanent comfort from the hour when they had
been alone with each other and the voices of the
world had been very far and faint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why did you want me to ride?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a simple question, but one not so easily
answered. She could have told him the truth, that
she did not want Larry Silcott to win. But that
would have been only part of the truth. She wanted
Rowan McCoy to win, wanted it more than she had
wished anything for a long time. Yet why? She
was not ready to give a candid reason even to herself,
far less to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Womanlike, she evaded. “Why shouldn’t I want
you to win? You’re my friend. I thought——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He surprised himself almost as much as he did
her by his answer. “I’m not yore friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him, startled at his brusqueness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a man that loves you,” he said roughly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tremor passed through her. She was conscious
of a strange sweet faintness. The soft eyes veiled
themselves beneath dark lashes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I spoiled everything, little partner?” he
asked gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I tell—yet?” she whispered, and looked
up at him shyly, tremulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew, as his arms went around her, that he
had entered upon the greatest joy of his life.</p>

<h3>FATE FLINGS OPEN A CLOSED DOOR</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>R</span>OWAN McCOY drove his new car—it was a
flivver, though they did not call it that in
those days—with the meticulous care of one
who still distrusts the intentions of the brute and
his own skill at circumventing them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he skidded to a halt in front of the store with
brakes set hard a woman came out to the porch and
nodded to him. She waited until the noise of the
engine had died before she spoke:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going down to Wagon Wheel, Mac?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I can stay with this gasoline bronc that far.
Anything I can do for you, Mrs. Stovall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman hesitated, her thin lips pressed tight
in an habitual expression of dry irony. She moved
closer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That houn’ Joe Tait has been a-beatin’ up Norma
again. She phoned up she wanted to get down to
the train. I’ve a fool notion she’s quittin’ him for
good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cattleman waited in silence. It was not a
habit of his to waste words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wanted I should find someone to take her and
her traps to Wagon Wheel. But seems like everybody’s
right busy all of a sudden.” A light sarcasm
filtered through the thin, cool voice of the postmistress.
“Folks just hate to be onneighbourly, but
their team has done gone lame or the wife’s sick or
the wagon broke a wheel. O’ course it ain’t that
any of them’s afraid to mad that crazy gunman,
Tait. Nothin’ like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy looked across at the blue-ribbed mountains.
Mrs. Stovall noticed that the muscles stood
out like ropes on the brown cheeks of his close-gripped
jaw. She did not need to ask the reason.
Everybody in the Hill Creek country knew the story
of Norma Davis and Rowan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not asking you to take her, Mac,” the woman
ran on sharply. “You got more right to have a
flat tire than Pete Henderson has to have——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is she?” interrupted the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll find her the yon side of the creek.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stovall knew when she had said enough.
Silently she watched him crank the car and drive
away. As he disappeared at the rim of the park a
faint, grim smile of triumph touched her sunken
mouth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ’most knew he’d take her,” she said aloud to
herself. “Course there’ll be a rookus between him
and Joe Tait, but I reckon that’s his business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At intervals during the morning that sardonic
smile lit the wrinkled face. It was an odd swing of
the pendulum, she thought, that had reversed the
situation. Years ago Norma had run away from
her lover with good-for-nothing Joe Tait. Now
she was escaping from Tait with McCoy by her side.
How far would fate carry the ironic jest? Mrs.
Stovall was no Puritan. If Norma could unravel
some scattered threads of happiness from the tangled
skein of her wretched life, Martha Stovall cared little
whether she kept within the code or not. No
woman was ever more entitled to a divorce than the
abused wife of the sheepman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A woman came out from the cottonwoods beyond
the ford to meet McCoy. She was dressed in a cheap
gown hopelessly out of date, and she carried a
telescope valise with two broken straps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If any of the bitterness McCoy had felt toward her
when his wound was fresh survived the years it must
have died now. Life had dealt harshly with her.
There had been a time when she was the belle of all
this ranch country, when she had bloomed with
health and spirits, had been as full of fire as an
unbroken bronco. Now her step dragged. The
spark of frolicsome deviltry had long been quenched
from her eye. Her pride had been dragged in the
dust, her courage brutally derided. Even the good
looks with which she had queened it were marred.
She was on the way to become that unattractive
creature, the household drudge. Yet on her latest
birthday she had reached only the age of twenty-six.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At recognition of the man in the car she gave a
startled little cry:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—Rowan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the first time they had been alone together
in seven years, the first time she had directly addressed
him since the hour of their quarrel. At the
unexpectedness of the meeting emotion welled up
in her throat and registered there like the quicksilver
in a thermometer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tossed her grip into the back of the car, along
with his own, and turned to help her to the seat
beside the driver. For just an instant she hesitated,
then with a bitter, choking little laugh gave way.
What else could she do? It was merely another
ironic blow of fate that the lover she had discarded
should be the man to help her fly from the destiny
her wilfulness had invited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In silence they sat knee to knee while the car rolled
the miles. The distant hills and valleys which slid
indistinguishably into each other detached themselves
as they approached, took on individuality, vanished
in the dusty rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither of them welcomed the chance that had
thrown them together again. It shocked the pride
of the woman, put her under an obligation to the man
against whom she had nursed resentment for years.
His presence stressed the degradation into which
she seemed to herself to have fallen. For him,
too, the meeting was untimely. To-day of all days
he wanted to forget the past, to turn over a page
that was to begin the story of a new record. Deliberately
he had shut the door on the story of his
unhappy love for Norma Davis, and with an impish
grin fate had flung it open again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heady wilfulness of the girl had given place
to the tight-lipped self-repression of a suffering
woman. Not once in all the years had she complained
to an outsider. But her flight was a confession.
The stress of her feeling overflowed into words bitter
and stinging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got your revenge, Rowan McCoy. If I
treated you shabbily you can say ‘I told you so’ now.
They used to say I was too proud. Maybe I was.
Well, I’ve been paid for it a thousand times. I’ve
got mighty little to be proud of to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Norma!” he pleaded in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the instinct of one who bites on an ulcerated
tooth to accent the pain, she drew up a loose sleeve
and showed him blue-and-yellow bruises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look!” she ordered in an ecstasy of self-contempt.
“I’ve hidden this sort of thing for years—and worse—a
hundred times worse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hound!” His strong, clenched teeth smothered
the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the mood of the woman changed. She
would have none of his sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m a fool,” she snapped. “I’ve made my bed.
I’ll lie in it. This world wasn’t built for women,
anyhow. Why should I complain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never a talkative man, McCoy said nothing now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had reached the Fryingpan, and the road
wound down beside the little river as it tumbled
toward the plains over bowlders and around them.
The trout were feeding, and occasionally one leaped
for a fly, a flash of silver in the sunlight. Both
of them recalled vividly the time they had last gone
fishing here. They had taken a picnic lunch, and
it had been on the way home that a quarrel had
flashed between them about the attentions of Joe
Tait to her. That night she had eloped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman noticed that McCoy was not wearing
to-day the broad-rimmed white felt hat and the
wrinkled corduroys that were so much an expression
of his personality. He was in a new, dark suit, new
shoes, and an up-to-date straw hat. The suitcase
that jostled her shabby telescope valise would have
done credit to a Chicago travelling salesman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going to take the train,” she suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Cheyenne,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, I’m going to Laramie, if——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She cut her sentence short. It was not to be
presumed that he cared where she was going. Moreover,
she could not finish without telling more than
she wanted to. But McCoy guessed the condition.
She would go if she could borrow at Wagon Wheel
the money for a ticket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They drove into the county seat long before train
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where shall I take you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Moody’s, if you will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He helped her from the car and carried the valise
into the store. Moody was in the cubby-hole that
had been cut off from the store for an office. Rowan
hailed him cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Trent. What’s the best price you
can give me for those hides?” He walked toward
the storekeeper and bargained with him audibly,
but he found time to slip in an undertone: “If Mrs.
Tait wants any money, give it to her. I’ll be responsible.
But don’t tell her I said so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moody grinned dubiously. He was a little embarrassed
and not a little curious. “All right, Mac.
Whatever you say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Rowan went out of the office Norma timidly
entered. Moody was a tight, hard little man, and
she did not expect him to let her have the money.
If he refused she did not know what she would do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy strolled down to the station to inquire
about the lower he had reserved in the Pullman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re in luck, Mac,” the station agent told him.
“Travel is heavy. There isn’t another berth left—not
even an upper. You got the last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’m out of luck, Tim,” smiled the cattleman.
“A lady from our part of the country is going to
Laramie. Give her my berth, but don’t let her know
I had reserved it. The lady is Mrs. Tait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A quarter of an hour later Norma Tait, not yet
fully recovered from her surprise at the ease with
which she had acquired the small roll of bills now
in her pocketbook, learned from the station agent
that there was one sleeper berth left. She exchanged
three dollars for the ticket, and sat down to wait until
the Limited arrived. It was a nervous hour she
spent before her train drew in, for at any moment her
husband might arrive to make trouble. That she
saw nothing more of Rowan McCoy before the Limited
reached Wagon Wheel was a relief. Tait had
always been jealous of him, and would, she knew,
jump to the wrong conclusion if he saw them ready
to leave together. At the first chance she vanished
into the Pullman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just as the conductor shouted his “All aboard!”
a big, rawboned man galloped up to the station and
flung himself from the saddle. He caught sight of
McCoy standing by the last sleeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What have you done with my wife?” he roared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The train began to move. McCoy climbed to the
step and looked down contemptuously at the furious
man. “Try not to be a fool, Tait,” he advised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man running beside the train answered the
spirit of the words rather than the letter. “You’re
a liar. She’s in that car. You’re running away
with her. You sneak, I’m going in to see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caught at the railing to swing himself up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cattleman wasted no words. His left fist
doubled, shot forward a scant six inches, collided
with the heavy chin of Tait. The big sheepman’s
head snapped back, and he went down heavily like
a sack of meal.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='ch8'>CHAPTER VIII</h1></div>

<h3>A COLD TRAIL</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE white-rimmed eyes of the porter rolled
admiringly toward McCoy as the cattleman
disappeared into the sleeper. “Some kick,
b’lieve me!” he murmured to the world at large.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan stopped at the section where Norma Tait
sat. “I’m going forward to the day coach,” he explained.
“If there’s anything I can do for you,
Norma, now or at any time, I want you to call on
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman looked at him, a man from his soles
up, coffee-brown, lean, steady as a ground-sunk rock.
She knew his standing in the countryside. His
fellows liked him, trusted him, followed him, for by
the grace of Heaven he had been born a leader of men.
McCoy was no plaster saint. The wild and sometimes
lawless way of his kind he had trodden, but
always there burned in him the dynamic spark of
self-respect that lifted him above meanness, held
him to loyalty and decency. It came to her with
a surge of emotion that here a woman’s love could
find safe anchorage. What a fool she had been to
throw him aside in the pride of her youth!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I ask favours of you? What have
I ever done but bring trouble and unhappiness to
you?” she cried in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind that. If there’s anything I can do
for you I’m here to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gulped down a sob. “No, you’ve done enough
for me—too much. Joe will hear that you drove me
to town. He’ll make trouble for you. I know him.”
A faint flush of anger dyed her thin cheeks. “No,
I’ll go my road and you’ll go yours. I’m an old
woman already in my feelings. I’m burned out,
seems like. But you’re young. Forget there was
ever such a girl as Norma Davis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated, uncertain what to say, and while he
groped she spoke again:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a girl waiting for you somewhere, Rowan.
Go and find her—and marry her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath the tan he flushed, but his eyes did not
waver. “I’m going to her now, Norma.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now?” Her surprised glance swept the dark,
new suit and the modish straw hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She’s waiting for me at Cheyenne. We’re to be
married to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After just an instant came the woman’s little,
whispered cry: “Be good to her, Rowan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded, then shook hands with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you be good to yourself, Norma. Better
luck ahead.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave a little wry smile. “Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy passed forward to the day coach. From
the train butcher he bought a magazine and settled
himself for a long ride. He intended to spend the
night where he was, even if a vacant berth should
develop later in the sleeper. Tait would mole out
quite enough evidence against him without any
additional data supplied by indiscretion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Red Gulch a big, tanned Westerner entered the
car and stopped beside the cattleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Lo, Mac,” he nodded genially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Lo, Sheriff! Ain’t you off your range?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big man was booted and spurred. As he sat
down something metallic on his hip struck the woodwork
of the seat arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Been looking for a horse thief I heard was at
Red Gulch. False alarm,” he explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t any of us strike a warm trail every
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right.” The cool, hard eyes of Sheriff
Matson rested quietly in those of the cattleman.
“Wonder if I’m on one now. I’ve been asked to
arrest a man eloping with another man’s wife, Mac.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon Tait phoned you from Wagon Wheel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You done guessed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s gone crazy with the heat. False alarm, sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Says his wife is aboard this train. Is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Says you took him by surprise and knocked him
cold on the depot as the train was leaving.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s made a record and told the truth twice
running.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s she going? Mrs. Tait, I mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Laramie. Her sister lives there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Running away from Tait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks like it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the sheriff’s hard gaze searched McCoy.
“Came down from Bovier’s camp with you in your
car, I understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I gave her a lift down.” Rowan’s voice
was as even as that of the officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suppose you give me a bill of particulars, Mac.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cattleman told a carefully edited story. When
he had finished, Matson made one comment: “Tait
says she hadn’t a dollar. Wonder where she got the
money for a ticket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of the two men met in the direct, level
fashion of the country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going anywhere in particular in those glad rags,
Mac?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff’s question was dropped lightly, but
McCoy did not miss its significance. He knew that
for the sake of Norma’s reputation he must remove
all doubt from the mind of the officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, Aleck. I’m going to Cheyenne,” he
assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A cattle deal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly—object-matrimony, Sheriff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matson shot a direct, stabbing look at him.
“You’ve told me too much or too little.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The young lady is named Trovillion. She spent
two months at the Dude Ranch this summer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff rose. “Nuff said, Mac. I wasn’t
elected to do Tait’s dirty work for him. I get off
at this crossing. So long, old scout—and good luck
to you on that object-matrimony game.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Left to himself, Rowan did not at once return to
his magazine. His mind drifted to the girl he was on
his way to marry. It was likely these days, whenever
he was not busy, to go back to her, magnetized
by the lure of her dark-eyed beauty. The softness
and fragility of his sweetheart moved him to awe.
That her fancy had selected him out of so many
admirers was to him still an amazing miracle. He
did not know that the mystery back of his silence
had captured her imagination just as the poignancy
of her piquant charm had laid a spell on his.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='ch9'>CHAPTER IX</h1></div>

<h3>A RIFT IN THE LUTE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HEY were married. And in swift procession
the months followed the weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the Circle Diamond, Ruth queened it
with a naïve childishness from which her youth had
not yet escaped. Eagerly she played at housekeeping
for a fortnight under the amused eyes of Mrs.
Stovall, who had been employed by McCoy to do
the cooking, her term as postmistress having expired.
The next game that drew her was the remodelling
of the house. Carpenters and decorators from
Wagon Wheel came up, filled the place with litter
and confusion, and under the urge of the young
mistress transformed the interior of the unsightly
dwelling into a delightful home. An absorbing
period of needlework followed. New and pretty
dresses took shape and were exhibited to Rowan,
who did not have to feign admiration. For if she
had been Paris gowned the slender grace of the girl
could not have been enhanced in his eyes. She had
a native instinct for style, a feeling for the harmonies
and values of dress. Whatever she wore became an
expression of her personality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth’s husband confessed to himself with a sinking
heart that she did not really belong on a frontier
ranch. The girl wife brought to her new home all
the fastidiousness that had charmed him. Her
sewing room was cheerful with Indian paint brushes
and columbines, her little bedroom a study in delicate
blues. He was glad of that. He did not want
the dust of the commonplace to dull her vividness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It pleased him that she accepted lightly all responsibility
except that of having a good time. She
had shipped her own piano to Wyoming, and she
played a good deal. Sometimes she read a little,
more often rode or hunted. Occasionally Rowan
joined her on these excursions, but usually she went
alone. For business more and more absorbed his
time. The war between the sheep and cattle interests
was becoming acute. Ranchmen, watching the
range jealously, saw themselves being pushed closer
to bankruptcy by Tait and his associates. Already
there had been sheep raids. Cattle had been found
dead at the water holes. Bullets had sung back and
forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though Rowan could spend little time with
the girl he had married, a deep tenderness permeated
his thought of her. It was still a miracle to him that
she had come to the Circle Diamond as his wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he rode the range he carried with him mental
etchings of her little graces—the swiftness of the
ready smile, the turn of the small, beautifully poised
head, the virginal shyness that always captivated
him. He missed sheer joy because he was profoundly
unsure of holding her. Ruth, he felt, was in love
with life, and he was merely a detail of the Great
Adventure. Some day she might grow weary, take
wings, and fly. Meanwhile a certain diffidence born
of reticence sealed his lips. He found it impossible
to express the emotion he knew so poignantly. It
was of the hill code that a man must not show his
naked soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On an August morning Ruth, dawdling over breakfast
alone, glimpsed through the dining-room window
a rider galloping toward the ranch. Since Rowan
had been in the saddle and away long before she was
awake, the young woman answered the hail from
without by going to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horseman had dismounted, flung the bridle
rein to the ground, and was coming up the porch
steps when Ruth appeared. He lifted the broad hat
from his curly head and bowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rowan at home?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he isn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swift anger blazed in the eyes of the girl. She had
seen this slender, black-haired stranger twice before,
once in the orchard of the Dude Ranch, again astride
a volcanic bronco in the arena at Bad Ax.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some wise instinct warned him not to smile. He
spoke gravely. “Sorry. I’ve got news for him.
It’s important. Where is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he say when he would be back?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Ruth cut short the conversation curtly.
“I’ll send one of the boys to talk with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned and walked into the house, leaving
him on the porch. Out of the tail of her eye she
caught sight of her husband riding into the yard with
his foreman. From the dining-room window she
presently watched McCoy canter away in the company
of Silcott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth was annoyed, even though she recognized
that her vexation at Rowan was not quite fair. It
was true that he had lately fallen into a habit of disappearing
for a day at a time without explanation of
his absence. He was worried about something, and
he had not made a confidante of her. This was bad
enough, but what she resented most was the fact
that he was on the best of terms with the handsome
young scamp who had kissed her so blithely in the
orchard. Of course she had no right to blame her
husband for this, since she had never told him of the
episode. Yet she did. For her mind moved by impulse
and not by logic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She wandered into the kitchen and whipped together
a salad for luncheon. She knitted two rows
on a sweater at which she was working, and flung it
aside to plunge into one of Chopin’s waltzes at the
piano. But Ruth was not in the mood for music.
Restlessly she turned to a magazine, fingered the
pages aimlessly, read at a story for a paragraph or
two, then with a sudden decision tossed the periodical
on the table and walked out of the house to the
garage. Yet a minute, and she was spinning down
the road toward Bovier’s Camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was such a day in late summer as comes only to
the Rockies. From a blue sky, flecked with a few
mackerel clouds, poured a bath of sunshine. Her
lungs drank in an air like wine, pure and strong.
The sunny slopes of the high peaks pushed up into
the rare, untempered light of Wyoming. The scent
of the pines was in her nostrils. Once, when she
stopped to look at a doubtful tire, the murmurous
voices of the desert whispered in her ears. In spite
of herself Ruth’s heart answered the call of the distant,
shining mountain to rejoice and be glad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The car topped the rim of the saucer-shaped valley
and swept down toward the little village. What
Ruth saw quickened her blood. Beyond the post
office a great huddle of sheep was being driven forward.
At the head of them rode a man with a rifle
in one hand lying across the horn of the saddle. On
the porch of the store sat Larry Silcott and her husband
watching the man steadily. Neither of them
carried any arms exposed to view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young wife drove the car down the basin and
stopped near the store, leaving the engine still running.
None of the men even glanced her way.
Their eyes were focused on each other with a tenseness
that made her want to scream. She waited,
breathless, uncertain what to expect. The pulse in
her throat beat fast with excitement. That a collision
of some sort impended she did not need to be
told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man with the rifle spoke thickly in a heavy,
raucous voice: “I’ve been looking for you, Rowan
McCoy. First off, I’ll tell you something. I’m here
with my sheep like I promised, on the way to Circle
Diamond. I’m going right past the door of the
ranch to Thunder Mountain. If any man tries to
stop me, I’ll fix his clock. Get that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan’s eyes were like chilled steel, his body
absolutely motionless. “Better turn back while you
can, Tait,” he advised quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll see you in hell first. I’m going through.
But there’s another thing I’ve got to settle with you,
Rowan McCoy. That’s about my wife. Stand up
and fight, you white-livered coyote!” A sudden
passionate venom leaped into the voice of the sheepman.
He cursed his enemy savagely and flung at
him a string of vile names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth, terror-stricken, believed the man was working
himself up to do murder. She wanted to cry out,
to rush forward and beg him to stop. But her throat
was parched and her limbs weighted with heavy
chains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your wife left you because you are a bully and
a drunkard. I had nothing to do with her going,”
retorted McCoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a liar—a rotten liar! You got her to run
away with you. You took her in your car to Wagon
Wheel. You gave her money to buy a ticket. You
were seen on the train with her. I swore I’d kill you
on sight, and I’m going to do it. Get out of the way,
Silcott!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The energy flowed back into Ruth’s limbs. She
threw in the clutch and drove forward furiously.
There was the sound of a shot, then of another.
Next moment she was pushing home the brake and
shutting off the gas. The car slammed to a halt,
its wheels hard against the porch. She had driven
directly between the sheepman and his intended
victim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the haze that for a moment enveloped
Ruth’s senses boomed a savage, excited voice:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Turn me loose, Mac! Lemme go! I’ll finish
the damned sheepman while I’m on the job.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene opened before her eyes like a moving-picture
film. On the porch her husband was struggling
with a man for the possession of a gun, while
young Silcott was sagging against a corner pillar,
one hand clutched to his bleeding shoulder. Thirty
yards away Tait lay on the ground, face down, beside
his horse. From the corral, from the store, from the
adjoining doctor’s office men poured upon the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The place was suddenly alive with gesticulating
people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan tore the rifle from the man with whom he
was wrestling. “Don’t be a fool, Falkner. You’ve
done enough already. I shouldn’t wonder if Tait
had got his.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had it coming to him, if ever a man had. If
I’d been two seconds later you’d have been a goner,
Mac. I just beat him to it. Good riddance if he
croaks, I say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy caught sight of Ruth. He moved toward
her, his eyes alive with surprise and dismay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You—here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t hit you!” She strangled a sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Falkner fired from the store window. It
must have shaken his aim. He hit Larry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan turned swiftly to his friend, who grinned
feebly up at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’S all right, Mac. I’ll ride in a heap of round-ups
yet. He punctured my shoulder.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good! Let’s have a look at it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fat little man with a doctor’s case puffed up to
the porch as McCoy was cutting away the shirt of the
wounded man from the shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here! Here! Wha’s the matter? Lemme see.
Get water—bandages,” he exploded in staccato
snorts like the engine of a motor cycle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth flew into the house to obey orders. When
she returned with a basin of water and towels the
doctor had gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doc is over looking at Tait,” explained her
husband. “Says Larry has only a flesh wound.
We’ll take him home with us in the car. You don’t
mind?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course we’ll look after him till he’s well,” Ruth
agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t think of troubling you, Mrs. McCoy,”
objected Silcott. “All I need is——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rest and good food and proper care. You’ll
get it at the Circle Diamond,” the girl interrupted
decisively. “We needn’t discuss that. You’re going
with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had her way, as she usually had. After
Doctor Irwin had dressed the shoulder the young
ranchman got into the back seat of the car beside
Ruth. McCoy asked a question point-blank of the
fussy little physician:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about Tait? Will he live?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ought to. If no complications. Just missed
lower intestines—near thing. Lot of damn fools—all
of you!” he snorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure thing,” grinned Silcott. “Come and see
me to-night, Doc.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’mp!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll be looking for you, Doctor Irwin,” Ruth
called back from the moving car.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor growled out what might be taken for a
promise if one were an optimist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the rim of the valley McCoy looked down
and spoke grimly: “I notice that Tait’s herders have
changed their minds. They’re driving the sheep
back along the road they came.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before we’re through with them they’ll learn
where to head in,” boasted Larry querulously, for his
wound was aching a good deal. “Next time they cross
the dead line there’ll be a grave dug for someone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wouldn’t say that, Larry,” objected Rowan
gently. “We’d better cut out threats. They lead
to trouble. We don’t want to put ourselves in the
wrong unnecessarily. Take Falkner now. I was
just in time to keep him from finishing Tait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Falkner! He’s crazy to be a killer. But
at that I don’t blame him this time,” commented
the younger man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silcott went to bed in the guest chamber between
clean sheets, and sank back with a sigh of content
into the pillow. The atmosphere of home indefinably
filled the room. The cool tints of the wall paper,
the pictures, the feminine touches visible here and
there, all were contributing factors, but the light-footed
girl, so quiet and yet so very much alive in
every vivid gesture, every quick glance, was the
centre of the picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that she had something on her mind,
that she was troubled and distrait. He thought he
could guess the reason, and felt it incumbent upon
him to set himself right with her. When, toward
evening, she brought him a dainty tray of food he
could keep away from the subject no longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was a sweep,” he confessed humbly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant she did not know what he meant.
Then: “Yes,” she agreed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry. You’ve made me ashamed. Won’t
you forgive me?” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth had plenty of capacity for generosity. This
good-looking boy was ill and helpless. He appealed
strongly to the mother instinct that is alive in all
good women. He was the central figure, too, of
an adventure which had excited her and intrigued
her interest. Moreover, she was cherishing a new
and more important resentment, one which made
her annoyance at him of small moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean it? Are you really sorry?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. “I think so. I know I ought to be.
Anyhow, I’m sorry you’re angry at me,” he answered
with a little flare of boyish audacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bit her lip, then laughed in spite of herself.
She held out her hand a little hesitantly, but he knew
he was forgiven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Silcott’s fever mounted toward evening,
but when Doctor Irwin arrived he gave him a sleeping
powder and before midnight the wounded man
fell asleep. Ruth tiptoed about the room while she
arranged on a little table beside the bed his medicines
and drinks in case he awakened later. After lowering
the light she stole away silently to her own bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan knocked a few minutes later. He heard
her move across the floor in her soft slippers. She
wore a dainty crepe-de-Chine robe that lent accent
to the fresh softness of her young flesh. She had
just been brushing her hair, and the long, heavy,
blue-black braids were thrown forward over her
shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All day McCoy had been swept by waves of tenderness
for this girl wife of his who had risked
her life to save him by driving into the line of fire
so pluckily. He had longed to open his heart to her,
and he had not dared. Now there was a new note
about her that puzzled him, one he had never seen
before. The eyes that flashed into his were fierce
with defiance. Her slim figure was very erect and
straight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was taken aback. Never before had her
manner been less than friendly to him. While she
was in this mood he could not voice his surcharge
of feeling for her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are tired,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden gusty passion flared in her face. “Did
you come to tell me that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. To thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For risking your life for me this morning. It was
splendid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She dismissed his thanks with a contemptuous little
snap of finger and thumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that’s all you have to say——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all, except good-night, dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Definitely she refused his wistfulness, definitely
withdrew into herself and met his appeal icily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good-night.” Her voice rejected flatly the love
he offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always he had been chary of embraces with her.
To him she was so fine and exquisite that her kisses
were a privilege not to be claimed of right. Now he
merely hid his hurt with a patient smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you’ll sleep well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes flamed with scorn. She closed the door.
He heard the key turn in the lock. Rowan knew that
she was locking him out of her heart as well as out of
the room.</p>

<h3>THE RIFT WIDENS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>CROSS the breakfast table next morning
Rowan faced a hostile young stranger. The
gay comrade who was so dear to him, the
eager, impulsive girl all fire and flame and dewy softness,
had vanished to give place to a cold and flinty
critic. Abruptly and without notice she had withdrawn
her friendship. Why? Was it that she had
grown tired of him and what he had to offer? Or
had he done something to displease her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Manlike, he tried gifts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve decided to have that conservatory built for
you off the living room as soon as I can get the glass.
Better draw up your plans right away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve changed my mind. I don’t want it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her voice was like icy water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” he said gently, and presently he finished
his breakfast and left the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth bit her lip and looked out of the window.
Tears began to film her eyes. She went to her room,
locked the door, and flung herself down on the bed
in a passion of weeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ever since the first days of her acquaintance with
Rowan she had known the story of how Norma Davis
had jilted him. Mrs. Flanders, of the Dude Ranch,
was a gossip by nature and had told Ruth the history
of the affair with gusto. The girl had been merely
interested. She had had too many transient affairs
herself to object to any dead and buried ones of
Rowan. But yesterday afternoon she had ridden
over to the summer resort and asked Mrs. Flanders
some insistent questions. The mistress of the Dude
Ranch was a reluctant witness, but a damning one.
It was true that Mrs. Tait had run away with McCoy
in his car and that they had taken the train together.
There were witnesses to prove that he had paid for
the sleeper berth she used and that it was in his name.
For once Joe Tait had told the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thing which hit Ruth like a sudden slap in the
face from a friend was that this escapade had taken
place while McCoy had been on his way to marry
her. It was not an episode of the past, but a poisonous
canker that ate into the joy of her life. If he
could do a thing so vile there was no truth in him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the golden hours they had spent together were
tainted by his infidelity. Never in all her life had
she met a man who had seemed so genuine, so wholly
true. She had offered him her friendship and love,
had given her young life into his keeping. His
reverence for her had touched her deeply. Now she
knew there was nothing but hypocrisy to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She must leave him, of course. She must crawl
away like a wounded wild creature of the forest and
suffer her hurts alone. The sooner she left the
better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the very heel of this resolution came Mrs.
Stovall with bad news about their patient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His fever’s mighty high. Looks like someone
will have to nurse that boy regular for quite a while,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll look after him—anyhow till the doctor
comes,” Ruth volunteered in swift compunction
because she had not been in to see him that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’mp! Been crying her eyes out. What’s <span class='it'>she</span>
got to worry about—with the best man in the Fryingpan
country crazy about her?” wondered the housekeeper.
“Trouble with her is that Rowan’s too good
to her. She needs to bump up against real grief
before she’ll know how well off she is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once installed in the sick room, Ruth did not find
it easy to get away. For three days Silcott needed
pretty constant attention. After the delirium had
passed he lay and watched her, too weak to wait
upon himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll not leave me,” he whispered to her once,
and there was something so helpless and boyish about
his dependence upon her that Ruth felt a queer little
lump in her throat. Just now at least there could
be no doubt of the genuineness of <span class='it'>his</span> need of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not till you’re better,” she promised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if there were tears in her eyes they were less
for him than for herself. She was thinking of another
man who had told her how greatly he needed
her and how her coming had filled his life with sunshine,
of another man whose whole relation to her
had been a lie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was like Larry to take her emotion and her
kindness as evidence of her special interest in him,
just as it had been characteristic of him a few days
before to jump to the conclusion that her worry was
on his account. He was a debonair young fellow,
picturesque and good-looking. Nor did Ruth resent
it that he claimed it as a privilege of his invalidism to
pass into immediate friendship with her. His open
admiration of her was balm to the sick heart of the
girl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the days that followed Rowan caught only
glimpses of his wife. She was never up now in time
for his early breakfast. All day he was away, and
she contrived to be busy with her patient while Mrs.
Stovall served his supper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whenever they did meet Ruth incased herself
instantly in a still white armour of reserve. She
treated him to no more of her winsome vagaries,
never now mocked him with her dear impudence.
He noticed that she never called him by name and
that her manner was one of formal politeness. In
his presence her joy was struck dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A less sensitive man might have come to grips
with her and fought the thing out. Once or twice
Rowan tried in a halting fashion to discover the cause
of the change in her, but she made it plain to him
that she would not discuss the matter. At the bottom
of his heart he had no doubt as to the reason. She
had found out that his ways were not hers. He held
no resentment. It was natural that her eager youth
should weary of the humdrum life he offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sometimes, as he passed Silcott’s room, Rowan
heard the gay laughter of the young people. Later,
when Larry was strong enough, McCoy met them
driving, on their way to a picnic for two. If the
sight of their merriment was a knife in his heart,
Rowan gave no sign of it. His friendly smile did
not fail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better come along, Mac. You’ll live only once,
and then you’ll be dead a long time,” suggested
Larry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy shook his head. “Can’t—business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He noticed that Ruth had not seconded the invitation
of her companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though he never intruded, it was impossible for
Rowan to live in the same house without running into
them occasionally. Sometimes she would be accompanying
Larry on the piano while he sang
“Mandalay.” Or they would be quarrelling over a
verse in a volume of recent poems. Rowan was not
of a jealous disposition, but their good-fellowship
stabbed him. He neither sang nor read poems.
What was worse, he was not on good enough terms
with Ruth for her to quarrel with him. The most
he could get from her was frigid politeness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth was in the grip of one of the swift friendships
to which she was subject. She liked Larry a lot.
They had many common interests. But she plunged
into her little affair with him only because misery
made her reckless. Quite well she knew that Larry’s
coaxing smile, his dancing eyes, his boyish winsomeness,
cloaked a purpose of making love to her as
much as he dared. She felt no resentment on that
account. Indeed she was grateful to him for distracting
her from her woe. To her husband she
owed nothing. If she could hurt him by playing his
own game so much the better. For conventions
she never cared. As for Larry, when the time came,
she told herself, she would know how to protect her
heart. She was willing to flirt desperately with him,
but she had no intention of really caring for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because she was such a child of impulse, so candid
and so frank, Rowan worried lest her indiscretions
should be noticed. He did not like to interfere, but
he considered dropping a hint to Larry that he was
needed at the Open A N C.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not necessary. Over the telephone one
morning came the news that Miss Morgan, who was
still stopping at the Dude Ranch, had suffered a
relapse and was not expected to live. Ruth fled
at once to join her and Larry discovered a few hours
later that he was well enough to go home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Ruth nursed her aunt through the silent hours
of the night her mind was busy with her own shattered
romance. She confessed to herself that she had
not really been having a good time with Larry. She
had turned to him as an escape and to punish her
husband. But all the while her heart had been full
of bitterness and desolation. It was unthinkable
that Rowan could have treated her so. Her young,
clean pride had been dreadfully humiliated. It
seemed to her that her heart was frozen, that she
never again could pulse with warm life. The thing
that had fallen upon her was a degradation. In
her thoughts she held herself soiled irretrievably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Morgan died the third day after the arrival
of her niece. In accord with a desire she had once
expressed, she was buried in a grove back of the
pasture at the ranch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth accepted the invitation of Mrs. Flanders
to stay a few days at the Dude Ranch as her guest.
The days lengthened into weeks, and still she did
not return to the Circle Diamond. Larry made
occasions to come to the hotel to see Ruth. Sometimes
Rowan came, but not often. The gulf between
him and his young wife had widened until he despaired
of bridging it. He felt that the kindest thing
he could do was to stay away. The whole passionate
urge of his heart swept him toward her, but his iron
will schooled his impulses to obedience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as Rowan rode the range he carried with him
the memory of a white face, fragile as a flower, out
of which dark eyes looked at him defiantly. His
heart ached for her. In his own breast he carried
a block of ice that never melted, but he would gladly
have taken her grief, too, if that had been possible.</p>

<h3>LARRY GOES CALLING</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>R</span>UTH and Mrs. Flanders sat on the porch at
Elkhorn Lodge and watched a rider descend
a hill trail toward the ranch. It was late
in the season. Except a hunting party, only a few
stray boarders remained, and these would soon take
flight for the cities. But in spite of the almanac
the day had been hot. Even after sunset it was
pleasant outdoors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rider announced his coming with song. For
a fortnight he had been on the round-up, working
sixteen hours a day, and now that it was nearly over
he was entitled to sing. The words drifted down to
the women on the porch:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Larry Silcott,” announced Mrs. Flanders,
brightening. She was a born gossip. When the
owner of the Open A N C was with her there was a
pair of them present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” assented Ruth. She had known for some
moments that the approaching rider was Larry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He offered for their entertainment another selection.</p>

<p class='line0'>I’ll cut you toppy mounts, boys, now pair off and rip.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>After a few moments of silence the wind brought
more song to the women on the porch:</p>

</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The young man appeared to catch sight of the

<p class='pindent'>He cantered up to the ranch, flung himself from
the saddle without touching the stirrups, grounded
the reins, and came forward to the porch with jingling
spurs. Ruth did not deny that he was a most
engaging youth. The outdoor bloom on his cheeks,
the sparkle in his eyes, the nonchalant pose that had
just a touch of boyish swagger, all carried their appeal
even with women old enough to be his mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is the round-up finished?” asked Mrs. Flanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ve got to comb Eagle Creek yet and the
Flat Tops.” He fell into the drawl of the old cowman.
“But I’m plumb fed up with the dust of
the drag driver. Me, I’m through. Enough’s
plenty. The boys can finish without Larry Silcott.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seem to have quite an attack of doggerel
to-night,” suggested Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doggerel nothing. Every one of ’em is a range
classic. I got them from old Sam Yerby, who
brought them up from Texas. I’ve been giving you
the genuwine, blown-in-the-bottle ballads of the man
who wears leathers,” defended Larry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is boss of the round-up this year?” asked
Mrs. Flanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rowan is, and believe me he worked us to a
fare-you-well. He’s some driver, Mac is; one of your
sixty-horsepower dynamos on two legs. He is
good for twenty-four hours a day himself, and he
figures the rest of us are made of leather and steel,
too. I’m a wreck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that I hear about Falkner and Tait having
some more trouble?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Trouble is right, Mrs. Flanders. They met
over by the creek at Three Willows. One thing
led to another, and they both got down from their
horses and mixed it. Tait had one of his herders
with him, and he took a hand in the fracas. The
two of them gave Falkner an awful beating. He was
just able to crawl to his horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tait ought to be driven out of the country,”
pronounced Mrs. Flanders indignantly. “He’s always
making trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joe is certainly a bad actor, but it would be some
job to drive him away. He hasn’t got sense enough
to realize what is going to happen to him. If Falkner
ever gets him at the wrong end of a gun——” He
left his sentence unfinished. The imagination could
supply the rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They say Tait has driven his sheep across the
dead line again.” Mrs. Flanders put her statement
as if it were a question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, recalling a warning he had been given, became
suddenly discreet. “Do they?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will the Hill Creek cattlemen stand for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a sullen, mulish look on his face that
suggested he knew more than he intended to tell.
“Maybe they will. Maybe they won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Business called the Mistress of Elkhorn Lodge into
the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth, with a slant of dark eyes toward her guest,
asked him a question: “Do you call this two weeks?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I call it a month, reckoning by my feelings.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She scoffed. “It’s a pity about your feelings.
I told you not to come again for two weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought as I happened to be passing——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On your way to nowhere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“—that I’d drop in and say ‘<span class='it'>Buenas tardes</span>.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good of you, I’m sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He settled himself comfortably on the porch
against a pillar. “I want to ask your advice. I’m
just a plain cow-puncher and you’re a wise young
lady from a city. So you can tell me all about it.
I’m getting old and lonesome, and my mind has been
running on a girl a heap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her glance took in the slim, wiry youth at her feet.
She smiled. “You’d better ask Mrs. Flanders. I’m
too young to advise you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. You’re just the right age. I’ll tell you
about her. There never was anybody prettier—not
in Wyoming. She’s fresh and sweet, like those wild
roses we picked in Bear Creek Cañon. Her eyes
are kind o’ rippled by a laugh ’way down deep in
them, then sometimes they are dark and still and—sort
of tender. She has the kindest heart in the
world—and the cruelest. I wouldn’t want a better
partner, though she’s as wild as an unbroken bronc
sometimes. You never can tell when she’s going to
bolt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a faint flush of pink in her cheeks, but
her eyes danced. “You don’t make her sound like
a really <span class='it'>nice</span> girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s nice enough, when she isn’t a little
divvle. The trouble is she isn’t foot-loose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course she is tremendously in love with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She likes me a heap better than she pretends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure she would adore you if she knew how
modest you are,” Ruth answered with amiable
malice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silcott’s gaze absorbed her dainty sweetness. He
spoke with an emphasis of the cattleman’s drawl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like right well to take her up on my hawss
and ride away with her like that Lochinvar fellow
did in the poetry book y’u lent me onct—the one
that busted up the wedding of the laggard guy
and went a-fannin’ off with his gyurl behind him,
whilst the no’count bridegroom and her paw hollered
‘Help!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lochinvar. Oh, he’s out of date.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe so. But it’s a great thing to know when
to butt in.” He watched her covertly as he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when not to,” added Ruth, with the insolent
little tilt of her chin that made men want to
demonstrate. “Come on. Let’s go over to the
mesa and look at the desert in the moonlight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath the stars this land of splintered peaks
and ragged escarpments always took on a glory
denied to it by day. The obscuration of detail, the
vagueness of outline, lent magic to the hills. Below,
the valley swam in a sheen of gleaming silver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth drew a deep breath of sensuous delight and
lifted her face to the star-strewn sky. Her companion
watched her, his eyes shining. She was
standing lance straight, everything forgotten but the
beauty of the night. In the air was a faint, murmurous
stir of desert denizens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The world’s going to bed,” she whispered. “It
always says its prayers first—wonderful prayers
full of the fragrance of roses and the sough of wind
just touching the pines, and the far, far song of birds.
You have to listen—oh, so still!—before you can
hear them. The world is sad because the lovely
day is dead and because life is so short and so filled
with loss, and it’s just a wee bit afraid of the darkness.
So God lights up millions of candles in His sky as a
sign that He’s up there and all’s well with the universe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry had another Ruth to add to his list of portraits
of her. It was amazing how many women
were wrapped up in her slim young body, not to
mention the Ruth that was a naughty child and the
one that was all eager boy. He had known her in the
course of a morning grave and gay, whimsical and
coquettish, sulky and passionate. She was given
to generous impulses and unjust resentments. At
times her soul danced on the hilltops of life, and
again she beat with her fists indignantly at the bars
that prisoned her. Of late he had more than once
surprised her with the traces of tears on her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew that all was not well between her and
Rowan, but he did not know what was amiss. Only
Mrs. Flanders guessed that, and for once she kept
her own counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry slipped his big brown hand over her little
one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’re not happy just the same,” he told her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was one of those men whose attitude toward a
young and attractive woman is always that of the
lover potential or actual. He was never quite satisfied
until the talk became personal and intimate,
until he had established an individual relationship
with any woman who interested him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth nodded agreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She let her hand lie in his. Since her break with
Rowan she was often the victim of moods when she
craved a sympathy such as Larry offered, one that
took her trouble for granted without discussing it.
There were other times when her spirit flared into
rebellion, when she was eager to punish her husband’s
faithlessness by letting Silcott make veiled love to
her with only a pretense of disapproval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you chuck it all overboard and make
a new start?” he asked her abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him, a little startled. He had never
before made so direct a reference to her situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care to talk about that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you’ll have to talk about it some time.
You can’t go on like this for ever, and—you know I
love you, that I’d do anything in the world for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know you talk a lot of foolishness, Larry,”
she retorted sharply. “I may be a goose, but I’m
not silly enough to take you seriously all the time.
Let’s go back to the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why you can’t take me seriously,”
he said sulkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you’re only a boy. You think you
want the moon, but you don’t; at least the only
reason you want it is because it’s in somebody else’s
yard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It doesn’t need to stay there always, does it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t a matter for you and me to discuss,”
she flashed at him with spirit. “Whenever I need
your advice I’ll ask for it, my friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She led the way to the house, her slender limbs
moving rhythmically with light grace. Larry walked
beside her sullenly. What was the matter with
her to-night? Last week she had almost let him
kiss her. If she had held him back, still it had been
with the promise in her manner that next time he
might be more successful. But now she had pushed
him back into the position of a friend rather than a
lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry had no intention of being her friend. It was
not in his horoscope to be merely a friend to any
charming woman. Moreover, he was as much in
love with Ruth as he could be with anybody except
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before they reached the porch she asked him
a question: “When will they be through with the
round-up?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In two or three days. Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I just wondered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes evaded his. His annoyance flashed suddenly
into words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it’s Rowan you want, why don’t you go back
to him like a good little girl and say you’re sorry?
I expect he would forgive you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anger, sudden and imperious, leaped into her eyes.
“I wish you’d learn, Larry Silcott, to mind your own
business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned and fled into the house.</p>

<h3>ACROSS THE DEAD LINE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>N</span>OWHERE outside of Cattleland would such
a scene have been possible. The air was
filled with the fine dust of milling cattle,
with the sound of bawling cows and blatting calves.
Hundreds of them, rounded up on the Flat Tops and
driven down Eagle Creek, were huddled in a draw
fenced by a score of lean brown horsemen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now and again one of the leggy hill steers made a
dash for freedom. The nearest puncher wheeled
his horse as on a half dollar, gave chase, and headed
the animal back into the herd. Three of the old
stockmen rode in and out among the packed cattle,
deciding on the ownership of stray calves. These
were cut out, roped, and branded on the spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody was busy, everybody cheerful. These
riders had for weeks been in the saddle eighteen
hours out of the twenty-four. They were grimy
with dust, hollow-eyed from want of sleep. But
every chap-clad, sun-baked horseman was hard as
nails and tough as leather. To feel the press of a
saddle under his knees in all this clamour and confusion
was worth a month of ordinary life to a cow-puncher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy, since he was boss of the round-up, was
chief of the board of arbiters. An outsider would
have been hopelessly at a loss to decide what cow
was the mother of each lost and bewildered calf.
But these experts guessed right ninety-nine times
out of a hundred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Goes with the big bald-faced cow—D Bar Lazy
R brand,” was the verdict of Rowan as to one roan
stray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You done said it, Mac!” agreed Sam Yerby,
chewing his quid of tobacco lazily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third judge, Brad Rogers, of the Circle B R,
nodded his head. Duncan King, whose father
owned a ranch near the headwaters of Hill Creek,
cut out the bawling little maverick for the branders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the outfit was at supper after the day’s
work a man rode up to the chuck wagon and fell into
the easy, negligent attitude of the range rider at
rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hello, Larry! Come and get it,” shouted the
cook, waving a beefsteak on the prongs of a long fork.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silcott slid from the saddle and joined the circle.
He found a seat beside McCoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to see you alone, Mac,” he said in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan nodded, paid no more attention to him,
and joined again in the general conversation. But
presently he got up and strolled toward the remuda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry casually joined him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tait has been across the dead line for two days,
Mac. He’s travelling straight for the Circle Diamond
with fifteen hundred sheep. About a third
of them belong to Gilroy. Joe has two herders with
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are they camped to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the foot of Bald Knob.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Gilroy with them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He was this morning, but he telephoned
his wife from Westcliff that he would be home to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boss of the round-up looked away at the
purple hills, his close-gripped jaw clamped tight, his
eyes narrowed almost to slits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Drift back to the wagon, Larry, and tell Yerby
and Rogers to drop out of the crowd and meet me
here quietly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure.” The younger man hung in the wind.
“What are you going to do, Mac?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silcott broke into a sudden angry oath. “Do?
I’d meet Joe Tait halfway. I’d show him whether
he can spoil the range for us at his own sweet will.
He wants war. By all that’s holy, I’d carry it right
into his camp!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan did not deny to himself the seriousness of
the issue as he waited for the coming of the two men.
He faced the facts squarely, as he always did. Tait
had again declared war. To let the man have his
own way meant ruin to the cattle interests on the
Fryingpan. For if one sheepman were permitted
to invade the range, dozens of others would drive
across into the forbidden territory. The big, fearless
bully had called for a show-down. Let him win
now, and it would be a question of months only
until McCoy and his neighbours were sold out at a
sheriff’s sale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the darkness sauntered Yerby, followed
presently by Rogers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s on yore mind, Mac?” drawled Yerby,
splattering expertly with tobacco juice a flat rock
shining in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam Yerby was an old cowman from Texas.
As a youth he had driven cattle on the Chisum Trail.
Once, a small boy, he had spoken with Sam Bass, the
outlaw. In the palmy days of Dodge City and
Abilene, while still in his early teens, he had been a
spectator of the wild life that overflowed into the
frontier towns. Physically he was a wrinkled little
man with a merry eye and a mild manner that was
apt to deceive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tait has crossed the dead line again. He is
headed for the Thunder Mountain country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yerby rubbed a bristling cheek slowly with the
palm of his hand. “Well, I’ll be dog-goned! Looks
like he’s gone loco,” he commented mildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The owner of the Circle B R broke into excited
threats. “He’ll never take his sheep back again—never
in the world. I’ll not stand for it; none of
the boys will. Right now is when he gets all the
trouble he wants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That your opinion, too, Sam?” asked Rowan
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The faded blue eyes of the Texan had a far-away
look. His fingers caressed a chin rough with gray
stubbles. He was thinking of his young wife and his
year-old baby. Their future depended upon his little
cattle ranch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon, Mac. We got to fight some time.
Might as well be right now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-night,” agreed McCoy decisively. “We’ll
settle this before daybreak. We don’t want too
many in this thing. Five or six are enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here are three of your six,” suggested Rogers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Larry Silcott is four. We’ve got to take Larry.
He brought me the news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about Dunc King? He’s a good boy—absolutely
on the square.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan shook his head. “Let’s keep Dunc out
of this. You know what a good old lady Mrs. King
is. We’ll not take her only son into trouble. Besides,
Dunc talks too much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Jack Cole. He’ll go through and padlock
his mouth, too. I’d trust Jack to a finish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cole is all right, Brad. You feel him out. Five
of us are all that’s needed. We’ll meet at the Three
Pines at midnight. Sam, you and Brad can decide
to spend the night at home since we’re camping so
near your places. I’ll drive my bunch of cows
down to the Circle Diamond as an excuse to get
away. I can take Jack and Larry with me to help.
Probably you had better hang around till after we’ve
been gone a while.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Circle Diamond cattle were cut out from the
bunch and started homeward. Rowan, with Silcott
and Cole to help him on the drive, vanished after
them into the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Funny Mac didn’t start at sunset. What’s the
idea of waiting till night?” asked King of Falkner,
who sat beside him at the campfire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beats me.” Falkner scowled at the leaping
flames. His face was still decorated with half a
dozen ugly cuts and as many bruises, souvenirs of
his encounter with Tait. Just now he was full of
suspicions, vague and indefinite as yet, but none the
less active. For Larry had told him the news he
had brought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sing the old Chisum Trail song, Sam,” demanded
a cow-puncher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A chorus of shouts backed the request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cain’t you boys ever leave the old man alone?”
complained Yerby. “I done bust my laig to-day
when I fell off’n that pinto. I’ve got a half a notion
to light a shuck for home and get Missie to rub on
some o’ that white liniment she makes. It’s the
healin’est medicine ever I took.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be a piker, Sam. Sing for us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’ll I sing? I done sung that trail song
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything. Leave it to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old Texan piped up lugubriously, a twinkle in
his tired eyes:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Come, all you old cow-punchers, a story I will tell,</p>
<p class='line0'>And if you’ll be quiet I’m sure I’ll sing it well,</p>
<p class='line0'>And if you boys don’t like it, you sure can go to hell!”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>A shout of laughter greeted this unexpected
proposition. “Fair enough.” “Go to it, Sam!” “Give
us the rest!” urged the chap-clad young giants
around the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yerby took up his theme in singsong fashion, and
went through the other stanzas, but as he finished
he groaned again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My laig sure is hurting like sixty. I’m going
home. Wish one of you lads would run up a hawss
for me. Get the roan with the white stockings, if
you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go with you, Sam,” announced Rogers.
“I’m expecting an important business letter and I
expect it’s waiting at the house for me. Be with
you to-morrow, boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After they had gone Falkner made comment to
young King satirically: “What with busted laigs
and important letters and night drives, we’re having
quite an exodus from camp, wouldn’t you say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks like,” agreed King. “Tha’s the way with
married men. They got always to be recollectin’
home ties. We been on this round-up quite a spell,
an’ I reckon they got kinda homesick to see their
better halfs, as you might say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tha’s yore notion, is it?” jeered Falkner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, you see——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Different here. They got a hen on. Tha’s
what’s the matter with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whajamean, a hen on?” King leaned forward,
eyes sparkling, cigarette half rolled. If there was
anything doing he wanted to know all about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Larry let it out to me at supper. He was so
full of it he couldn’t hold it in. Tait has done crossed
the dead line again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No?” The word was a question, not a denial.
Young King’s eyes were wide with excitement. This
was not merely diverting news. It might turn out
to be explosive drama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m tellin’ you, boy.” Falkner rapped out an
annoyed impatient oath. “They left me out of it.
Why? I got as good a right to know what’s doing as
any of ’em. More, by God! I’ve still got to settle
with Joe Tait for these, an’ I aim to pay him interest
aplenty.” He touched the scars on his face, and his
eyes flamed to savage anger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you reckon Mac aims to do?” asked
King.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon he means to raid Tait’s herd. Can’t be
anything else. But I mean to find out. Right now
I’m declarin’ myself in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The campfire circle broke up, and the cow-punchers
rolled into their blankets. Falkner did not stay in
his long. He slipped out to the remuda and slapped
a saddle on one of his cow ponies. The explanation
he gave to the night herders was that he was going to
ride down to Bovier’s Camp to get some tobacco.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He struck the trail of McCoy’s bunch of cows
and followed across the hills. Falkner rode fast,
since he knew the general direction the driver must
take. Within the hour he heard the lowing of cattle,
and felt sure that he was on the heels of those he
followed. From the top of the next ridge he looked
down upon them in the valley below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was enough for Falkner. Evidently Rowan
intended to get the cattle to his corral before any move
was made against Tait. The range rider swung to
the right across the brow of the hill, dipped into the
next valley, struck a trail that zigzagged up the shale
slope opposite, and by means of it came, after a half
hour of stiff riding, to the valley where the Triangle
Dot Ranch had its headquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tied his horse in a pine grove and stole silently
down to the bunk house. This he circled, came to
the front door on his tiptoes, and entered noiselessly.
A man lay sleeping on one of the farther bunks, arms
flung wide in the deep slumber of fatigue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner reached for a rifle resting on a pair of elk
horns attached to the wall, and took from one of the
tines an ammunition belt. He turned, knocked
over in the darkness a chair, and fled into the night
with the rifle in one hand, the belt in the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reaching the pine grove, he remounted, skirted
the lip of the valley, and struck at its mouth the trail
to the Circle Diamond. Three quarters of an hour
later he was lying on the edge of a hill pocket above
that ranch with his eyes fastened to the moonlit corral
in which stood two saddled horses.</p>

<h3>THE NIGHT RAID</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE moon was just going under a cloud when
Rowan and his two companions rode away
from the Circle Diamond. They had plenty
of time before the appointed hour at the Three Pines.
Since they expected to ride hard during the night,
they took now a leisurely road gait in and out among
the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was little conversation. Cole was not
friendly toward Silcott, though he had had no open
break with him. He still remembered with resentment
that night when Larry had flirted so outrageously
with Kate. To Jack Cole’s simple mind the
thing had carried the earmarks of treachery. The
two had been rather close. They had slept under
the same tarp many a time. He could not understand
the vanity which had driven Larry to a public
exhibition of his power with women. But he and
Kate had talked the thing out, had quarrelled and
made up. His sense of dignity kept him from settling
the matter with Silcott by the simple primitive
method of fisticuffs. Therefore he bottled up his
sense of injury under a manner of cool aloofness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yerby and Rogers were waiting for them beneath
the largest of the big pines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better ’light, boys,” suggested the Texan. “I
reckon we might as well kinder talk things over.
We aim to bend the law consid’able to-night. If
any of you lads is feelin’ tol’able anxious he’d better
burn the wind back to camp. Old Man Trouble
is right ahaid of us on the trail. Now’s the time to
holler. No use bellyachin’ when it’s too late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Think we’re quitters?” Larry demanded indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, son, I don’t allow you are. If I did you can
bet them fifteen-dollar boots of yours that you or
Sam Yerby one wouldn’t be here. What I’m sayin’
is that this is serious business. Take a good, square
look at it before you-all go ahaid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sam’s quite right,” assented McCoy. “We’re
going on a sheep raid, and against a desperate man.
We’re going to kill his sheep—ride them down—stampede
them. It’s not a nice business, and the
law is dead against us. I don’t like it a bit, but I’m
going because it is the only way to pound sense
into Tait’s fool head. We’ve got to do it or shut up
shop.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan spoke with a gravity that carried conviction.
He was a man notable even in that country
which bred strong men. His steel-gray eyes looked
out unafraid upon a world still primitive enough to
demand proofs of any man who aspired to leadership
among his fellows. McCoy had long since demonstrated
his fitness to lead. No man in the Fryingpan
country doubted this. Hence his words now carried
weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I stand pat,” said Silcott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cole nodded agreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good enough. But understand this: We’re not
man-killers. Tait is a bad lot, all right, but we’re
not out to get him. We’re going to mask, surprise
the camp, hold it up, do our business, then get out.
Is that plain?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plain as the Map of Texas brand,” assented
Yerby with a grin. “Listens fine, too. But what
have you arranged for Tait to be doing while you-all
is making him a prisoner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be sleeping, Sam. Here’s the layout.
One of the herders and the dogs will be with the sheep.
We’ll slip right up to the wagon and capture Tait
first thing. He’s a heavy sleeper—always was.
Once we get him the rest will be easy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Texan nodded. “Ought to go through as per
plan if the sheep are far enough from the wagon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They’ll be far enough away so that the dogs
won’t bark at us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is that?” cried Rogers, pointing to the trail
below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of them with one consent stopped to watch
the horseman riding up out of the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s Hal Falkner,” Cole cried in a low voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Falkner! What’s he doing here?” demanded
McCoy. He whirled on Silcott. “Did you tell
him where we were to-night, Larry?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told him something—that Tait had crossed
the dead line and was heading for Thunder Mountain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might have said that,” admitted Silcott a little
sulkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you tell any one else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. What’s ailin’ you, Mac?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just this. I don’t want to go to the penitentiary
because you can’t keep your mouth shut, Larry.
Falkner is the last man you ought to have told. I
don’t want him with us to-night. He’s too anxious
to get at Tait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well, I guess he’ll be reasonable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner rode up the trail out of the shadowy
gloom. “Thought you’d lose me, did you? Fine
stuff, boys. How’s yore busted laig, Sam? And
did you get that important letter, Brad? I know
you other lads got the cattle to the Circle Diamond
because I saw them there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want, Hal?” asked Rowan curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Me, Mac? Same as you. I want to shoot some
pills into Mary’s little lambs. Did you think I was
riding for my health?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t want you along with us. Our party’s
made up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Short and sweet, Mac. What’s the objection
to my company?” demanded Falkner frostily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No personal objection whatever, Hal. But we
don’t want any one along that has a grudge at Tait.
We’re fighting for the range, and we don’t intend
to settle any individual scores.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Suits me. I expect I can square accounts with
Joe Tait at the proper time without lugging all you
fellows along.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy looked directly at him. “This party is
ducking trouble, not looking for it, Hal. We intend
to get the drop on Tait and hold him prisoner till
we’re through. Our only targets will be sheep.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine! I’ll take orders from you to-night, Rowan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That makes everything all right then,” put in
Larry cheerfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy still hesitated. He knew of Falkner’s
gusty and ungovernable temper, and suspected the
bilious rancour of his ill will toward Tait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let him go,” decided Rogers impatiently.
“One more won’t do any harm, and we might need
him. Falkner is not a fool. He knows we can’t
afford to shoot up Tait or his men.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure I know it. What’s the use of so much
beefing? I’m going with you, whether or no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks like our anxious friend has elected himself
one of us,” Sam assented amiably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan was outvoted. He shrugged, and, against
his better judgment, gave up the point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode hard across a rough, hilly country.
The moon had gone under scudding clouds. It
had turned a good deal colder, and there was a feel
of rain in the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were following no trail, but were cutting as
near a bee-line as possible over mountains, through
gulches, and along washes. McCoy led them with
the sure instinct of the hillsman. The night was
dark, and the hill pockets they traversed were like
one another as peas in a pod. But there was never
a moment when he hesitated as to direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time was half-past two when Rogers struck
a match and looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bald Knob is less than a mile from here,” said
McCoy. “We’ll mask now in case we should bump
into the camp sooner than we expect. Think we’d
better cut out talking. We’ve got to surprise them.
If we don’t, Tait will fight and that isn’t what we
want.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew from his pocket half a dozen bandannas.
Each man made and fitted his own mask from a handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wind is from the north. That’s lucky,
because we’ve got to get at the camp from the south.
The dogs couldn’t scent us even if they are close
to the wagons,” Rowan explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dogs will be with the sheep. I ain’t worried
about them,” answered Rogers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They rode cautiously now, one after the other in
single file. From a ridge McCoy pointed out the
sheep camp at the foot of Bald Knob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll leave our horses in that clump of pines and
creep forward to the wagons,” he gave directions.
“Remember, boys. No shooting. We’re going to
get the drop on Tait and take him prisoner. If
we can’t do that, the raid is off. We’re not killing
human beings. Get that, Hal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner nodded sulkily. “I told you I was taking
orders from you to-night, Mac.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under cover of a hill they rode into the pines
and tied their horses. McCoy deployed his men in
such a way that they could move toward the camp in
a half circle. He put Cole on the extreme left, and
next to him Yerby, Rogers, Silcott, and Falkner in
the order named. Rowan chose the place on the
right for himself, because it was nearest the wagons.
He stationed Falkner next to him so that he could
keep an eye on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The raiders crept forward slowly through the
brush. It was a damp, cold night. Clouds in
battalions were sweeping across the sky. McCoy,
as he moved forward, took advantage of all the
cover he could find. He could see Falkner as a dark
shadow over to his left. Silcott was lost in the gloom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound of a shot shattered the stillness.
Falkner, the rifle in his hand smoking, let out the
exultant “Yip—yip!” of a cowboy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back to cover, boys!” yelled Rowan instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stumbled on a clump of grass and went down.
Before he reached his feet again the tragedy was
under way. Another shot rang out—a third—and a
fourth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tait, revealed by a fugitive moon which had
escaped from behind scudding clouds, was in the
door of the wagon, as he had often promised. The
rifle in his hand was pumping lead at the foes advancing
toward him from the brush. Flashes in the
darkness told Rowan that the cattlemen were answering
his fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head of the big sheepman lurched forward,
and the rifle slid from his hands out of the wagon
to the ground. At the same moment another man
leaped from the wagon and started to run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop firing!” ordered McCoy sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ran forward to protect the retreat of the sheepman,
but he was too late. Falkner fired. The
running figure doubled up like a jack-rabbit and went
down headfirst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy plunged straight for the second wagon.
He could hear a herder tumbling hastily out of it,
and he stood directly between the man and Falkner.
The runner was, he knew, scuttling into the brush for
safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let him go. Don’t shoot, Hal!” shouted McCoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner, panting, eyes burning with the lust of
battle, pulled up beside Rowan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whad you get in my way for?” he cried excitedly.
“We got to make a clean sweep now. Got to do it to
save ourselves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. You can’t get the others without getting
me first.” McCoy’s voice rang sharp and dominant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, man, don’t you see we’ve got to destroy
the evidence against us? Leggo my arm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan’s fingers had fastened upon the wrist of the
other like steel clamps. His steady eyes were deadly
in their intentness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to kill me before you kill them.
Understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yerby had reached the wagon. He spoke up at
once: “Mac is right. We’ve done too much killing
already. Good Lord, how did it start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner opened his lips to speak, then closed them
again. He looked at McCoy and waited savagely
for the accusation. But none came. Rowan said
nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First I knew Tait was in the wagon door with
his gun and we were all shooting. But someone
fired first and brought him out from the wagon. It
came from the right. Who was it, Mac?” demanded
Rogers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cole and Silcott joined them. They had been
examining the fallen men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Both of them are dead,” said Cole. “I can’t
hardly believe it. But it’s so. A bullet got Gilroy
right through the heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan looked up quickly. He was white to the
lips. “Gilroy? Did we kill Gilroy?” He turned
to Larry. “I thought you said he went home to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He telephoned his wife he would be home to-night.
Must have changed his mind.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It cost him his life, poor devil!” Rogers broke
out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t so sure it won’t cost us ours,” added
Yerby quietly. “If I’d known Gilroy was here to-night,
Sam Yerby wouldn’t have gone raiding.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right,” agreed Cole. “Tait is one proposition;
Gilroy is another. This whole country is
going to buzz now. He has hundreds of friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All of them recognized the truth of this. The
death of Tait alone would have stirred no resentment.
But Gilroy was an old-timer, a quiet, well-respected
man who had many friends. He had been sheriff of
the county some years before, and at the last election
had been chosen county commissioner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who killed him?” asked Rogers again. “Who
started this shooting? That’s what I want to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan answered quietly: “The less we know
about that the better, boys. We’re all tied up together
in this. In the excitement some of us have
gone too far. That can’t be helped now. We’ve
got to see it out together—got to stand back of
each other. Before the law we’re all guilty. The
only thing to do is to let to-night’s work be a mystery
that is never solved. We’ll fix up a story and all
stand by it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yerby broke a long silence. “Well, boys, we
better make our get-away. A whole passell of
sheriffs will be combing these hills for us soon. Posses
will be pouring in like buzzards to a water hole in the
desert. I reckon we had better fix up our alibis and
then burn the wind for home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t start pushing on our reins any too quick
to suit me,” Cole assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s the only thing to do,” agreed McCoy.
“Sam, you and Brad had better get back to your
homes, where you’ve been sleeping all night if any
one asks you. Falkner, you go back with us to the
ranch. We’ll fix up a story about how you joined
us there and bunked with Jack and Larry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about these?” Rogers indicated with his
hand the sprawling bodies of the sheepmen. His
voice was a whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We can’t do anything for them,” answered
Rowan. “We’ve got to think of ourselves. If we
talk, if we make any mistakes, we’re going to pay the
price of what we’ve done. We can’t explain we
didn’t intend to kill any one. We’re all in this.
The only thing to do is to stand together and keep
our mouths shut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody was in a sudden hurry to be gone.
They tramped back to the pine grove, and hurriedly
mounted, eager to put as many miles as possible
between them and what was lying at the foot of
Bald Knob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A light snow was already falling. They welcomed
it for the protection it offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve bumped into good luck to start with,”
said Larry to Cole. “The snow will blot out our
tracks. They can’t trail us now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cole nodded. “Yep. That’s so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the thing that had been done chilled their
spirits, and the dread as to what was to come of it
rested like a weight upon their hearts. Mile after
mile they rode, swiftly and silently. More than once
Larry glanced over his shoulder with a shudder.
He could see the snow sifting into the sightless eyes
that stared up at the breaking dawn. Always he
had laughed at the superstitions which rode ignorant
people, but now he was careful not to bring up
the rear of the little procession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once an elk crashed out of some brush fifty feet
from them. The sudden clamour shook their nerves
with dread.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner laughed, but there was only bravado in
his voice. “I could ’a’ brought that elk down if it
hadn’t been the closed season,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man riding next him did not speak aloud
the thought that flashed through his mind—that
it had been an open season on sheepmen an hour before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party broke up at the Three Pines after a
hurried agreement as to plans. They were all to meet
at the round-up. None of them was to know anything
about the raid until news of it came to the
camp from outside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yerby and Rogers rode into the hills, the rest down
to the Circle Diamond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They covered the ground fast, so as to get into the
house before any one was astir with the coming day.
Already gray was sifting into the sky, a warning
that the night was ending.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry, riding beside McCoy, looked furtively at
him and asked a question just as they came in sight
of the ranch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who shot Gilroy, Mac?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan looked at him with bleak, expressionless
eyes. “We all did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but——” His whisper died away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of us know who fired the shot. It doesn’t
matter. Never forget one thing, Larry. We’re all
in the same boat. We sink or swim together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. But whoever it was——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t know who it was,” McCoy lied. “We’re
not going to try to find out. Forget that, Larry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They stabled their horses and stole into the bunk
house. Fortunately it was empty, Rowan’s men
being at the round-up. McCoy left them there and
returned to the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He met Mrs. Stovall in the corridor. She was on
her way to the kitchen to begin the day’s work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been out looking at one of the horses,”
McCoy explained. “Colic, looks like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The housekeeper made no comment. It passed
through her mind that it was odd he should take his
rifle out with him to look at a sick horse.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='ch14'>CHAPTER XIV</h1></div>

<h3>THE DAY AFTER</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>R</span>OWAN closed the door of his bedroom with
a sick heart. It was characteristic of him
that he did not debate his responsibility
for the death of the two sheepmen. It did not matter
that he had repeatedly warned his friends not
to shoot nor that from the beginning to the end of
the affair he had not fired his rifle. He could not
escape the conviction of guilt by pleading to himself
that but for the heady folly of one man the raid
would have worked out as planned. Nor did it
avail to clear him that he had tried to save the life
of Gilroy and had protected the herders from the
blood lust of Falkner. Before the law he was a
murderer. He had led a band of raiders to an attack
in which two men had died.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rock upon which the venture had split was
Falkner’s uncontrolled venom. But for that first
shot and the triumphant shout of vengeance Tait
could have been captured and held safely a prisoner.
Now they all stood within the shadow of the gallows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shock of Gilroy’s death was for the time
deadened to McCoy by the obligation that lay on
him to look out for the safety of his associates. The
cattleman did not deceive himself for an instant.
The days when men could ride to lawless murder in
Wyoming were past. Tom Horn had been hanged
in spite of a tremendous influence on his behalf.
So it would be now. Shoshone County would flame
with indignation at the outrage. A deep cry for
justice upon the guilty would run from border to
border.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond doubt suspicion would be directed toward
them on account of their absence from the round-up
camp at the time of the raid. But unless some of
them talked there could be no proof. The snow had
turned out only a flurry of an inch or two, but it
was not likely Matson could reach Bald Knob before
night. This would give them till to-morrow morning,
by which time the trail would be obliterated. There
was the taste of another storm in the air. Unless
McCoy was a poor prophet, the ground would be
well covered with snow before midnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan had collected all of the bandannas used
as masks. He intended to burn them in the kitchen
stove as he passed through to breakfast. It could
not be proved that Rogers and Yerby had not slept
at home unless their wives got to gossiping, nor that
the others had not spent the night at the Circle
Diamond. On the whole they were as safe as men
could be who stood over a powder mine that might
be fired at any moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the breakfast bell sounded McCoy descended
by the back stairs to the kitchen. Mrs. Stovall was
just putting a batch of biscuits into the oven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you mind stepping outside and ringing
the bell, Mrs. Stovall?” Rowan asked. “Three
of the boys are sleeping in the bunk house. They
stayed there last night after we drove the bunch of
cows home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as his housekeeper had left the room
McCoy stepped to the stove, lifted a lid, and stuffed
six coloured handkerchiefs into the fire. When Mrs.
Stovall returned he was casting a casual eye over
the pantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not short of any supplies, are you, Mrs. Stovall?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m almost out of sugar and lard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better make out a list. I’ve got to send one o’
the boys to Wagon Wheel with the team to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The burden of keeping up a pretense of conversation
at breakfast rested upon the host and Jack Cole.
Silcott was jumpy with nerves, and Falkner was
gloomy. As soon as he was alone with the men on
the trail to the round-up camp McCoy brought
them to time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This won’t do, boys. You’ve got to buck up and
act as usual. You look as if you were riding to your
own funeral, Hal. You’re just as bad, Larry.
Both of you have ‘criminal’ written all over you.
Keep yore grins working.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What am I to do with this gun?” demanded
Falkner abruptly. “I got it last night from the bunk
house at the Triangle Dot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did anybody see you get it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have to bury it. You can’t take it into
camp with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With their knives they dug a shallow ditch back
of a big rock and in it hid the rifle. The ammunition
belt was put beside it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was perhaps fortunate that by the time they
reached camp the riders had scattered to comb
Plum Creek for cattle. Rowan sent his companions
out to join the drive, while he waited in camp for a
talk with Rogers and Yerby, neither of whom had
yet arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About noon the two hill cattlemen rode into the
draw. The men met in the presence of the cook.
They greeted each other with the careless aplomb of
the old-timer:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Lo, Mac!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Lo, Sam—Brad! How’s every little thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine. Missie done fixed my game laig up with
that ointment good as new. I want to tell you-all
that girl is a wiz,” bragged Yerby, firing his tobacco
juice at a white rock and making a centre shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy breathed freer. Yerby and Rogers could
be depended upon to go through the ordeal before
them with cool imperturbability. Cole, under fire,
would be as steady as a rock. Falkner and Silcott
were just now nervous as high-bred colts, but Rowan
felt that this was merely the reaction from the shock
of the night. When the test came they would face
the music all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Late in the afternoon the bawling of thirsty cattle
gave notice that the gathered stock were nearing
camp. Not until the stars were out was there a
moment’s rest for anybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Supper was eaten by the light of the moon. During
this meal a horseman rode up and nodded a greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young King caught sight of him first. “Hello,
Sheriff!” he shouted gaily. “Which of us do you
want? And what have we been doing now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan’s heart sank. Matson had beaten the
time he had allowed him by nearly twenty-four hours.
But he turned a wooden face and a cool, impassive
eye upon the sheriff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Lo, Aleck! Won’t you ’light?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reckon I will, Mac.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff swung from his horse stiffly and came
forward into the firelight. At least six pairs of eyes
watched him closely, but the tanned, leathery face
of the officer told nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anything new, Matson?” demanded a young
cow-puncher. “Don’t forget we’ve been off the
map ’most three weeks. Who’s eloped, absconded,
married, divorced, or otherwise played billiards with
the Ten Commandments?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matson sat down tailor fashion and accepted the
steak, bread, and coffee offered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The only news on tap when I left town was that
the Limited got in on time—yesterday. Few will
believe it, but it’s an honest-to-goodness fact. We
had it sworn to before a notary.”</p>

<h3>A HOT TRAIL</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>T happened that Sheriff Matson was in the
hills on official business and slept at Bovier’s
Camp the night of the sheep raid. He was by
custom an early riser. The sky was faintly pink
with the warning of a coming sun when he stepped
out of the house to wash in the tin basin outside the
kitchen. As he dried his face on the roller towel
there came to him the sound of dragging steps
and laboured breathing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matson turned. A pallid little man sank down
on the step and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s up?” demanded the officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The panting man lifted to him eyes which still
mirrored the fear of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They—they’ve killed Tait and Gilroy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Raiders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This morning—two hours ago.” A shiver shook
the fellow like a heavy chill. “My God—it was
awful!” he gasped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff let fall a strong brown hand on his
shoulder. “Tell me about it, Purdy. You were
there at the time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man nodded assent. He swallowed a lump
in his dry throat and explained: “I been herding for
Tait. We bedded at Bald Knob last night. Joe was
aiming to go to Thunder Mountain. They—shot
up the camp and killed Tait and Gilroy. Jim and
me just escaped. We got separated in the brush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just where was the camp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right at the foot of Bald Knob.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you recognize any of the raiders?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. They wore masks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How many were there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About twenty; maybe twenty-five.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re sure they killed Tait and Gilroy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t I tell you I saw them dead?” quavered
the unstrung man with weak irritability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cool, hard eyes of the sheriff narrowed to slits.
Matson belonged to the class of frontier man hunter
which sleeps on the trail of a criminal until he is
captured. Not hardship nor discouragement nor
friendship would stand in his way. He had a fondness
for his work that amounted to a passion and an
uncanny capacity for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the news that had just come to him he was a
changed man. The careless good nature was sponged
from his face. His features seemed to have sharpened.
His body had grown tense like a coiled spring.
There was in his motions the lithe wariness of the
panther stalking its prey for the kill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few more sharp, incisive questions told him all
Purdy knew. He ordered his horse to be saddled
and asked for breakfast at once. Meanwhile he got
Wagon Wheel on the long-distance, and rang his
deputy up from sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There has been a big killing at Bald Knob, Lute.
Drop everything else. Get together half a dozen
good men and ride up to Bovier’s Camp. Bring
with you supplies enough for several days. Wait
at the camp until you hear from me. Tait and
Gilroy killed. By cattlemen, looks like. I’ll know
more about that later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ate a hurried breakfast, gathered together a
couple of sandwiches for lunch, and struck across
country for the raided sheep camp. He plunged
into the gray desert, keeping the rampart of hills at
his left. In the early-morning light the atmosphere
gave to the panorama in front of him an extraordinary
effect of space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as he came in sight of the sheep camp
Matson dismounted and tied his horse. He had to
pick up a cold trail covered with snow. The fewer
unnecessary tracks the better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bodies of the sheepmen lay where they had
fallen, a light mantle of snow sheeting the still forms.
Three empty shells lay close to the rifle of Tait, but
Gilroy’s gun had not been fired. It was lying in
the wagon, where he had left it when he made his
dash to escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The contour of the country was such that the
attack must have been made from in front. Matson
put himself in place of the raiders, and guessed with
fair accuracy their plan of operations. The sun
had already melted most of the snow, and for hours
he quartered over the ground, examining tracks that
the untrained eye would never have seen. Sometimes
a bit of broken brush, sometimes a leaf trampled
into the ground, told him what he wanted to
know. Again, it was a worn heel plate that stood
out to him like a signpost on the road. Twice he
picked up an empty shell that had been thrown
out of a rifle during the rush forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boot tracks, faint though they were, led him
to the pine grove where the horses had been tethered.
Here he went down on his hands and knees, studying
the details of every hoofprint that differentiated it
from others. The care with which he did this, the
intentness of his observation, would have surprised
and perhaps amused a tenderfoot. An unskilled
tracker, though he might be a Sherlock Holmes in
the city, could have discovered nothing here worth
learning. Matson found registered marks of identification
for horses as certain as those of the Bertillon
system for criminals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With amazing pains he traced the retreat of the
raiders to the Three Pines. It was a very difficult
piece of trailing, for the snow had wiped out the
tracks entirely for stretches of hundreds of yards.
Once it was a splash of tobacco juice on a flat rock
that told him he was still on the heels of those he
wanted. In Shoshone County men will still tell you
that Aleck Matson’s feat of running down the night
raiders in spite of an intervening snowstorm was
the best bit of trailing they ever knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the Three Pines the tracks of most of the
party took the sheriff straight to the Circle Diamond
Ranch. He dropped in just in time to join Mrs.
Stovall at her midday dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They exchanged the casual gossip of the neighbourhood.
Presently he steered the talk in the direction
he wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mac is up at the round-up, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. He drove a bunch of cattle down last
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So? Any of the boys with him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three of them. They stayed in the bunk house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been wanting to see Art Philips. Was he
one of them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Young Silcott and Jack Cole and Hal
Falkner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Went back this morning, did they?” asked
Matson casually. He gave rather the impression
that he was making conversation to pass the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right after breakfast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jack Cole was talking about trading me a Winchester.
Don’t suppose he had it with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Hal Falkner had one. A deer had been
seen near camp, and he brought it on the chance
he might see it again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like a .30-30 for deer myself. Didn’t happen
to notice what Falkner carried?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stovall shook her head. “A gun is a gun to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When it comes to guns I reckon a man and a
woman are made different. I never see one without
wanting to look it over. Mac was going to show me
one of his next time I came up to the ranch. I don’t
suppose——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All his guns are in that little room off the living
room, as Mrs. McCoy calls the parlour. Go in and
look ’em over if you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff thanked her and availed himself of
the chance. When he came out he found Mrs.
Stovall clearing off the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Expect the boys were glad to come down and
eat a home-cooked meal at a real table. I’ll bet they
were so frolicsome at getting away from camp that
they kept you up all hours of the night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They woke me when they first came, but I soon fell
asleep. Likely they were tired and turned right in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds reasonable. Well, I’ll be moving along,
Mrs. Stovall. Much obliged for that peach cobbler
like Mother used to make.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his way to the stable Matson dropped in at the
bunk house. He made the discovery that at least
one of McCoy’s guests had lain on top of the blankets
and not under them. Nor had he taken the trouble
to remove his boots. The mud stains of the heels
were plainly printed on the wool.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer smiled. “Just made a bluff of lying
down; figured it wasn’t worth while taking off his
boots for a few minutes. I’ll bet that was Falkner.
He’s a roughneck, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matson rode back to the Three Pines, and from
there followed the trail of the two horses that had
turned into the hills at this point. By the middle of
the afternoon it brought him to the Circle B R, a
ranch which nestled at the foot of the big peaks in a
little mountain park.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It took no clairvoyant to see that Mrs. Rogers
was not glad to see him. Unless her face libelled
her, she had been weeping. Her eyes flew a flag
of alarm as soon as they fell upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“G’afternoon, Mrs. Rogers. Brad home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He’s at the round-up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone back, has he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She considered a moment before a reluctant
“Yes” fell from her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Reckon I’ll ride over to the camp. Is it still
at the foot of the Flat Tops?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” Then, as if something within forced
the words out in spite of her, she added: “Are you
looking for Brad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to have a talk with him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes told him that she was in a flutter of apprehension.
He guessed that the dread which all
day had weighed on her heart was no longer a dull,
dead thing in her bosom. Her lips were ashen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe—maybe I could tell him what it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’ll ride over. When did he leave?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t rightly know just when,” she faltered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was clear that she feared to arouse his suspicion
by refusing to talk and that she was equally afraid
of telling too much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff smiled grimly as he rode across the
hills. He had five of the raiders identified already—five
out of either six or seven, he wasn’t quite sure
which. He glanced across toward Bald Knob,
and judged from the sky that it was already snowing
over there. If he had been at Wagon Wheel instead
of at Bovier’s Camp when Purdy panted in with the
news of the killing he could not have arrived in time
to pick up the trail. His luck had stood up fine.
That the evidence against the lawbreakers would
sift in to him now he had no doubt. He intended
that this should be the last night raid ever made in
Shoshone County. Unless the district attorney
fell down on his job, more than one of the Bald Knob
raiders would end with a rope around his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matson admitted to himself a certain surprise
that McCoy and Rogers should be involved in such
an affair. Sheep raids were one thing; murder
was quite another. The sheriff liked Rowan. The
cattleman was straight as a string. His word was
good against that of any man in the district. It
was known that he would fight, but it was hard to
think of him as planning the cold-blooded murder
of an enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff knew how high the feelings ran between
the sheep and cattle interests. The cattlemen knew
they were facing ruin because Tait and his associates
maintained the right to run sheep upon any range
just as others ran stock. To them it seemed that
the intruders had no right whatever to the range.
It belonged to cattle by right of a long-time prior
occupancy. Moreover, under the leadership of Tait
the sheepmen had been particularly obnoxious.
They had refused to recognize any dead line whatever
and their attitude had been in the nature of a boastful
challenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was generally known that several of the cattlemen
had personal grievances against Tait. First
there was McCoy, with one that dated back several
years. Silcott had been wounded by the sheepman
and Falkner had been badly beaten by him. Cole,
too, had quarrelled with him. One of these four
might have started the shooting, Matson reasoned,
or Tait might have done so himself. Legally, the
question was not a vital one, since Tait had been shot
down while defending his property against attack.
Those who had ridden on the raid were guilty of
murder no matter who fired the first shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet Matson was puzzled. McCoy had been the
leader of the group. There could be no doubt about
that. His was far and away the strongest personality.
And McCoy usually thought straight. He did
not muddle his brain with false reasoning. How,
then, had he come to do such a thing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the sheriff sat by the campfire at the round-up
later, it was even more difficult to think of this clean,
level-eyed boss of the rodeo as an ambusher by night.
The whole record of the man rose up to give the lie
to the story that he had ridden out to kill his foe
in the dark. While Sam Yerby entertained the boys
with one of his trail songs, Matson’s mind was going
over the facts he had gathered.</p>

<p class='line0'>“Whoopee ti yi yo, git along, little dogies,</p>
<p class='line0'>It’s your misfortune and none of my own.</p>

</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Sam looked around carefully, selected a flat rock
at the edge of the fire, and splashed the centre of it
accurately with tobacco juice. Give him a chew of
tobacco as a weapon and the Texan was the champion
shot of Wyoming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His singsong voice took up the next stanza:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Oh, you’ll be soup for Uncle Sam’s Injuns!</p>

<p class='line0'>You’re going to be beef steers by and by.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Matson did not listen to the song. He was no
longer thinking of McCoy. From the shadow where
he lounged his narrowed eyes watched Yerby intently.
He had not moved a muscle of his big body,
but every nerve had suddenly grown taut. For
he guessed now who the sixth man was that had
ridden on the sheep raid. Sam’s habit of selecting
a rock target for his tobacco juice had betrayed him.</p>

<h3>MATSON MAKES HIS GATHER</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>IKE wildfire the news spread through western
Wyoming that Tait and Gilroy had been
shot down in their sheep wagon by night
raiders. Soon there was no ranch so deep-hidden
in the hills, no herder’s camp so remote that the
story had not been carried there. The tale was a
nine-days’ wonder, a sensation that gave zest to
colourless lives. The identity of the raiders was a
mystery that promised much pleasant gossip.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furtive whispers of names began to be heard.
That of Falkner was mentioned first. He had made
threats against Tait, and he was known to be quarrelsome
and vindictive. Then the murmured gossip
took up the name of McCoy, added shortly to it those
of Cole and Silcott. It was known that all four of
the suspected men had been absent from the round-up
the night of the killing. Two of them were enemies
of Tait, the others had been mixed up in the cattle-sheep
feud. By their own statements they had all
been together during the hours when the raid took
place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gossipers had no direct evidence, but a great
deal of opinion was whispered back and forth in
corrals, on porches, and in the saddle. The sentiment
was general that Tait had for a long time laid
himself open to such an end. But Gilroy was a good
citizen, not turbulent, friendly to his neighbours.
His murder stirred a deep but not too loudly expressed
resentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Sheriff Matson moved about his business
of gathering evidence with relentless singleness
of purpose. He, too, heard whispers and followed them
to sources. He rode up and down the country
piecing this and that together until he had a net of
circumstance encircling the guilty ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From one of the herders whom McCoy had saved
he gathered valuable information. The man had
been awakened by the sound of firing. He had run
to the door of the wagon in time to see Gilroy shot
down. Tait was already down. The herder had
been saved by one of the attackers who had stood
between him and another and prevented the second
man from murdering him. The first man had called
the other one Hal. The raiders were all masked
and he had not recognized any of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t lost any of them raiders, Mr. Sheriff,”
the man said with a kind of dogged weakness. “If I
know too much, why someone takes a shot in the dark
at me an’ that’s the last of Johnnie Mott. No, sir, I
done told you too much already. I was plumb excited,
an’ maybe I ain’t got it jest the way it was. He
mighta called the other fellow Hardy instead of Hal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He might have, but he didn’t, Mott. Keep yore
mouth shut and you don’t need to worry about
gettin’ shot. I’ll look after you if you’ll stay right
here in town. You can hold down that job I got you
as janitor at the court house. Nobody’s gonna hurt
you any.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the whispers Matson heard took him to
Dunc King. That young man had, as usual, been
talking too much. The sheriff found him at his
mother’s ranch mending a piece of broken fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ’Lo, Dunc. How’s everything?” the officer asked
by way of greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man looked at him with suspicion and
alarm. “Why, all right, I reckon. How’s cases
with you, Sheriff?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hear you had a little talk with Hal Falkner
the night of the raid. Do you remember exactly
what he said to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no. I don’t remember a thing about it,”
the young man returned uneasily. He knew his
tongue had once more tripped him up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will if you think hard, don’t you reckon?
You remembered it well enough to tell Flanders and
Mrs. Henson. I’ll start you off. Falkner an’ you
were discussing the reason why so many men left
camp after supper. He told you Larry Silcott had
told him Tait was across the dead line again. Recollect
that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, no. I don’t guess I do, Sheriff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better, Dunc, onless you want to get into
mighty serious trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sho! Nothing to that, Sheriff. Nothing a-tall.
I might’ve got to shootin’ off my mouth the way I
sometimes do. Kinda playin’ like I was on the
inside, y’ understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or, on the other hand, you might be trying to
duck out from responsibility, Dunc. Don’t make
any mistakes, boy. You’re going to come through
with what you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I’m tellin’ you I don’t know a thing,” the
boy protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not what you told several other people. How
about it, Dunc? You want to be an accessory to
this crime?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir, an’ I ain’t aimin’ to be either. If I
knew anything I’d tell you, but I can’t tell you what
I don’t know, can I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man was no match for the sheriff. Before
Matson had left the place he knew all that King
did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Forty-eight hours later the sheriff with a posse rode
up to the Circle Diamond Ranch. Rowan McCoy
was sitting on the porch oiling a gun. The first
glance told him that Matson had two prisoners, the
second that they were Falkner and Silcott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matson swung from the saddle and came up the
steps to the porch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got bad news for you, Mac,” he said bluntly.
“You’re under arrest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cattleman did not bat an eye. “What for?”
he asked evenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For killing Gilroy and Tait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The damn fool’s going around arrestin’ everybody
he knows, Mac,” broke in Falkner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy observed that Falkner was hand-cuffed
and that Silcott was not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He asked the sheriff a question. “Do I understand
that you’ve arrested Hal an’ Larry for this,
too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mac. Larry behaved sensible an’ promised
not to make any trouble, so I aim to be as easy on
him as I can. Falkner had other notions. He tried
to make a gun play.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You takin’ us to Wagon Wheel, Aleck?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have a warrant for my arrest?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officer showed the warrant and Rowan glanced
over it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right,” said McCoy. “I’ll saddle up an’ be
ready in a jiffy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No need for that, Mac. Fact is, I’m not quite
ready to start. Got a little more business to do first.
If you don’t mind I’ll make the Circle Diamond my
headquarters for a few hours,” Matson proposed
amiably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The owner of the ranch answered pleasantly but
perhaps with a touch of sarcasm. “Anything you
say, Aleck. If yore boys are here at dinner time I
expect Mrs. Stovall can fix you-all up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure, Mac, an’ if he needs horses or guns probably
you can lend him a few,” Falkner added with
an oath. “An’ maybe a puncher or two to join his
damned posse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No use gettin’ annoyed, Hal,” the ranch owner
said quietly. “This looks like a silly business to
us, but Aleck has to make his play. He’s not arrestin’
us for pleasure. I reckon he thinks he’s got
some evidence, or maybe he wants to scare us into
thinkin’ he has some so he can pick up something
against someone else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll find I’ve got evidence aplenty, Mac,”
the sheriff answered mildly. “No hard feelings, you
understand. All in the way of business. Have I
got yore word if I don’t put the cuffs on you that
you’ll go with me to Wagon Wheel quietly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. We’re not desperadoes, Aleck. We are
just plain hill ranchmen. If you’d just mentioned
it we’d have come in without any posse to guard us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’mp!” The sheriff made no other comment.
He glanced at Falkner by way of comment on
McCoy’s criticism. “I’m leavin’ three of the boys
here, Mac. Be back here myself in a few hours,
I reckon. If I don’t get back I’ve arranged for you
to make a start for town about two o’clock. That
agreeable to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any time that suits you,” McCoy answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff was back within the specified time
limit. He brought with him Rogers and Yerby.
From a remark he dropped later McCoy learned
that Cole had been arrested earlier in the day at
Wagon Wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are makin’ quite a gather, Aleck,” said
Rogers. “There are several other ranchmen up
here you’ve overlooked. How about them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got all I want for the present, Brad,” the
sheriff replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His manner was not reassuring, nor was the fact
that he had picked out and arrested just the six men
who had been engaged in the night raid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silcott, temperamentally volatile, was plainly
downhearted. McCoy manœuvred so that he rode
beside him when they took the road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you worry, Larry,” the older man said
in a cheerful voice, but one so low that it carried
only to the ears of the man it addressed. “He can’t
make his case stick, if we all stand pat on our story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not worried, Mac, but he must know something
or he wouldn’t be arresting us. That’s a
cinch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He knows a little, an’ guesses a lot more, an’
figures probably that there’s a quitter among us.
That’s where his case will break down. All we’ve
got to do is to keep mum. In a week or so we’ll be
ridin’ the range again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” agreed Larry, but without conviction.</p>

<h3>PADLOCKED LIPS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>Y</span>ET though the public was in a measure prepared
there was a gasp of surprise when the
word spread that Sheriff Matson had arrested
and brought to Wagon Wheel six cattlemen from the
Hill Creek district. McCoy and Rogers were so
well and favourably known that the charge of murder
against them set tongues buzzing far and wide.
Yerby had not been so long in the district, but he, too,
bore the best of reputations. By reason of his riding
and his gay good-fellowship Larry Silcott was a
favourite with the young people. In the cattle
country, where he was best known, Jack Cole’s
character was as good as a letter of credit. Of the
six, Falkner alone bore a rather doubtful reputation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the news of the arrests reached the Dude
Ranch, Ruth was out on the mesa doing a sketch of
the sunset. She was not really painting to any
purpose, but had come out to be alone. It had
been a wonderful autumn day of purple hills and
drifting mists that wrapped the cañons in a gossamer
scarf of gray. Just below the mesa the valley lay in
a golden harmony of colour beneath a sky soft with
rain clouds. It was a picture that just now filled
Ruth with deep peace. The brush lay idle in her
fingers, and on the face of the girl was a soft and rapt
exaltation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a secret. Sometimes it filled her with a
wild and tremulous delight. Again she stood before
it with awe and even terror. More than once in the
night she had found herself weeping with poignant
self-pity. There were hours when her whole soul
cried out for Rowan, and others when she hated
him with all the passionate intensity of her untutored
heart. Life, which had been so familiar and
easy, took on strange and inexplicable phases. She
had become a mystery to herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A chill wind from the snow peaks swept the mesa.
Ruth gathered up her belongings and walked back
to the house. She slipped in quietly by the back
door, intent on reaching her room unnoticed. As
she passed the door of the big lounging room the
voice of Tim Flanders boomed out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tell you that if McCoy led that raid there was
no intention of killing Tait and Gilroy. I’ve known
Mac twenty-five years. He’s white clear through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth wheeled into the room instantly. She went
straight to Flanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who says Rowan led that raid?” she demanded,
white to the lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a long moment of silence. Then:
“He’ll clear himself,” Flanders replied lamely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young wife had not known her husband was
even suspected. She caught the back of a chair with
a grip so tight that the knuckles lost their colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me—tell me what you mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He tried to break it gently, but blundered out
that the sheriff had to arrest somebody and had
chosen McCoy among others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is he?” And when she knew: “Take
me to him!” she ordered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flanders wasted no words in remonstrance. He
agreed at once, and had his car waiting at the door
before Ruth had packed her suitcase. Through the
darkness he drove down the steep mountain road to
Wagon Wheel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time they reached town it was too late to
get permission of the sheriff to see her husband that
night, but Tim made arrangements by which she was
to be admitted to his cell as soon as breakfast was
over next morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth slept brokenly, waking from bad dreams to a
realization of the dreary truth. One of the dreams
was that they were taking Rowan out to hang him
and he refused to say good-bye to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she came to breakfast at the hotel it was
with no appetite. Tim insisted on her eating, but
the toast she munched at stuck in her throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You drink your coffee, anyhow, honey. You’ll
feel better,” he urged.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p class='pindent'>The limbs of the girl trembled as she followed the
jailer. The pulse in her throat was beating fast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At sight of her standing in the shadow of his cell,
Rowan drew a deep, ragged breath. The tired eyes
in the oval of her pale face held the weariness of woe.
Always the clear-cut, delicate face of his sweetheart
had touched him nearly, but now it seemed to have
the poignant, short-lived charm of a flower. The
youth in her was quenched. He had ruined her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His impulse was to sweep her into his arms and
comfort her, but he lacked the courage of his desire.
Every fibre of him was hungry for her, but he looked
at her impassively without speaking. The tragic
gravity of her told him that she had come as a judge
and not as a lover.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the guard had gone she asked her question:
“You didn’t do it, did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His throat ached with tightness. There was
nothing he could say to comfort her. He could not
even, on account of the others, tell her the truth
and let her decide for herself the extent of his guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me you didn’t do it!” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beneath the tan he was gray. “I’m sorry. I
wish I could tell you everything. But I can’t talk—even
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t talk!” she echoed. “When you are
accused of—of this horrible thing, aren’t you going
to tell everybody that it is a lie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “It isn’t so simple as that.
I can’t talk about the case because——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not asking you to talk about the case. I’m
asking you to tell me that you’re innocent—that it’s
all an awful mistake,” she ended with a sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you’ll only trust me—and wait,” he began
desperately. “Some day I’ll tell you everything.
But now—I wish I could tell you—I wish I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that you don’t trust me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I trust you fully. But the charge against
me lies against others, too. I can’t talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t even tell me that you didn’t murder
two men in their sleep?” Her voice was sharp. All
the pain and torture of the long night rang out in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He winced. “I’ll have to trust to your mercy to
believe the best you can of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can I believe when you won’t even deny
the charge? What else is there to think but that——”
She broke off and began to whimper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a step toward her, but a swift gesture of
her hand held him back. “No—no! You can’t
trust me. That’s all there is to it—except that
you’re guilty. I’d never have believed it—never in
the world—not even after what I know of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan longed to cry out to her to have faith in
him. He wanted desperately to bridge the gulf
that was growing wider between them, to have her
see that he had closed the door behind him and
must follow the course he had chosen. But he was
dumb. It was not in him to express his feeling in
words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Into the delicate white of her cheeks excitement
had brought a stain of pink. Eagerly she poured
out her passionate protest:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t mean me to think—surely you can’t
mean—that—that—you did this horrible thing!
You couldn’t have done it! The thing isn’t possible.
Tell me you had nothing to do with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt himself trapped in a horrible ambuscade.
He would not lie to her. He could not tell the truth.
If she would only have faith in him——</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no chance of that. To look at the
hostile, accusing gaze of this girl was to know that
he had lost her. She had demanded of him a confidence
that was not his to give, a pledge of innocence
he could not make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry,” he said again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her affronted eyes stabbed him. “That’s all you
have to tell me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you only knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dumb appeal of him might have moved her,
but it did not. She was too full of her wrongs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t know, and you won’t tell me. So
there’s nothing more to be said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly she broke down, turned away with a
sob, and through the blindness of her tears groped
to the door. She had rushed to him—to tell him
that she knew he was innocent, and he had repulsed
her, had made a stranger of her. In effect, he had
told her that he did not want her help, that he would
go through his trouble alone. If he had really loved
her—ah, if he had loved her, how differently he
would have acted! A great lump filled her throat
and choked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan watched her go, his fingers biting into the
palms of his hands. The hunger of his soul stared
out of his eyes.</p>

<h3>“I RECKON I’LL HANG”</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>M</span>ATSON nodded a pleasant good-morning,
offered his prisoner a cigar, and sat down
on the bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How’s everything, Mac?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cattleman smiled ironically. “Fine as silk,
Aleck. How are they a-coming with you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there’s anything you want, Mac, if the grub
don’t suit you or anything, just say the word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not complaining. You run a good hotel,
Sheriff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matson looked out of the barred window at the
warm sunshine flooding the yard. From where he
sat he could not see the blue, unclouded sky, but he
knew just how it looked. When his gaze returned
to McCoy it was grave and solicitous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to give you straight talk, Mac. Don’t
fool yourself. Shoshone County has made up its
mind. The men that killed Dan Gilroy are going
to hang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sounds cheerful, Aleck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m here for the last time to ask you to come
through. If you’ll give evidence for the State I can
save you, Mac.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy looked straight at him from cold, bleak
eyes. “We discussed this subject once before, Sheriff.
Isn’t once enough?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” returned the officer doggedly. “I’ve been
talking with Haight. Inside of twelve hours he’s
going to get a confession out of—well, never mind
his name. But the man’s weakening. He’ll come
through to save his skin. Mac, beat him to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cattleman laughed without mirth. “I reckon
this confession talk is come-on stuff. Even if any
of the boys knew anything, he wouldn’t tell it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wouldn’t he? You ought to know that there’s
always a weak link in every chain. In every bunch
of men there’s a quitter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So you’re offering me the chance to be that
quitter. Fine, Aleck! You’ve got a high opinion
of me. But why give me the chance? By your way
of it, I led the raid. There was bad blood between
me and Tait. I outfitted some of the boys with guns,
you say. According to your theory, I’m the very
man that ought to be hanged.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not a fool, Mac. I know you didn’t set out
to kill. If you ask me who started the gun play I can
come pretty near giving his name. It’s a cinch you
didn’t. One of your party has been talking, and
the rumour is that you saved the herders. Anyhow,
I don’t want to see you hang if I can help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good of you,” derided the prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s what is going to happen if you don’t
take my offer. You are going to trial first—and for
the killing of Gilroy. You’ll be convicted. The
Governor daren’t commute the sentence. Last call,
Mac. Will you come through?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Aleck. I don’t admit I have anything to
tell, but if I had I expect I’d keep my mouth shut.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll hang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe I will; maybe I won’t,” answered Rowan
coolly. “I can throw a cat through some of your
evidence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you think it. I’ve got you tied up in a
net you can’t break. One of the herders will testify
he heard you called ‘Mac’ just after the shooting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was news to McCoy, but he did not bat an
eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heard someone called Mac, you mean, Sheriff.
There are quite a few Macs in Shoshone County.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you don’t know that we have a witness
who saw Falkner take a rifle out of the Triangle
Dot bunk house a few hours before the raid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I heard Hal was anxious to shoot a deer for meat
for the camp.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gun was a .35 Winchester.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He used judgment. I always liked a .35 for
deer,” commented the prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A .35 will kill a man, too,” said Matson significantly.
“The shells I picked up in front of the camp
at Bald Knob would fit the gun taken from the rack
at the Triangle Dot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I had an imagination like you, Aleck, I’d go
in for writing these moving pictures. You’re plumb
wasting it here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matson rose. “No use spilling words. Are you
going to be reasonable or not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The men looked at each other with direct, level
gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I aim always to try to be,” replied McCoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, will you come through with what I want,
or will you hang?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since you put it that way, Sheriff, I reckon I’ll
hang.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You damn fool!” exploded the sheriff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was no censure in his voice. The cattleman
had done what he would have done under the
same test—come clean as a whistle from the temptation
to betray his accomplices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew you wouldn’t do it,” continued Matson.
“But I’ve given you your chance. Don’t blame
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy nodded. It was the business of a sheriff
to run down crime. The cattleman was too good a
sportsman to hold a grudge on that account, even
if the officer fastened a rope around his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though Rowan had been under no temptation
to turn State’s evidence, the sheriff left him worried
at what he had predicted as to a confession. He
might of course be telling the truth. The sheriff
had said that there is a weak link in every chain.
If so, who was the weak one among the prisoners?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rogers and Yerby were married. It was likely
that Haight and Matson might have been at their
wives to harry them into a confession. Women
did not always have the same point of view about
honour when their feelings were involved. They
might have insisted on their husbands saving themselves
if they could. But, somehow, neither Rogers
nor Yerby seemed the type of man to save himself
at the expense of others. Rogers he had known a
long time and had never found him anything but
reliable. Yerby had been in the neighbourhood
six or seven years. McCoy sized up the Texan as a
simple man, frank and direct in his thinking. On
all the evidence at hand he would live up to the code
by which he guided his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other three were single men. There would be
less excuse for one of them if he betrayed his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry Silcott! No, certainly not Larry. Rowan
had tied the young fellow to him by a hundred
favours. Moreover, Larry lived in the sunshine of
popular applause. He could not go into the witness
box to testify against his companions without for
ever forfeiting the good opinion of all decent people.
It could not be Larry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jack Cole! He felt confident it was not Jack.
The young fellow was of the stuff that carries through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This left Falkner. Rowan considered Falkner
with no assurance of his loyalty. The man was wild,
reckless, and undisciplined. It was hard to predict
what he would do under any set of circumstances.
He had the reputation of being game, but he was
given to suspicions and resentments. It was possible
that if they plied him in just the right way he might
burst out in invectives against his companions.
Suppose, for instance, Haight persuaded him that
the others were planning to deliver him as the sacrifice.
On the other hand, Falkner was in a different
class from the others. He had fired the first shot.
He had killed Gilroy and knew that McCoy knew it.
If he went on the stand against the others his accomplices
would be free to fling the onus of the murders
upon him. No, Falkner would not dare weaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan’s thoughts drifted from the problem
Matson had left with him and reverted to his wife.
He was more unhappy about his relationship with
her than about the danger to his life. She had asked
for his confidence and he had refused it. What else
could he do? But his sick heart told him that she
had opened a door to the chance of a better understanding
between them and he had been forced to
shut it again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Life was full of little ironies that embittered and
made vain the best intentions.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='ch19'>CHAPTER XIX</h1></div>

<h3>SAM YERBY SINGS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>ATER in the day the sheriff tried out another
of his prisoners. He had told McCoy the
truth. One of the six was weakening. Matson
had his own favourites and wanted to give them
a chance before the State’s attorney was pledged.
By sunset a confession would be in the hands of
Haight, and it would be too late to save his friends.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found Yerby whittling out a boat for his baby.
The Texan looked up with a faint, apologetic smile
in his faded blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was making a pretty for my little trick at home,
Sheriff. He’s the dad-blamedest kid you ever saw—keeps
his old dad humping to make toys for him
to bust. Don’t you blame Steve for loaning me this
two-bit Barlow. He takes it back every night.
Steve’s a good jailer all right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Southerner was a shabby little man, tobacco-stained,
with a week’s growth of red stubble on his
face. But it was impossible to deny him a certain
pathetic dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come to talk to you for that little kid, Sam.
You don’t want him to be an orphan, do you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon that don’t rest with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matson cut straight to business. “That’s just
who it rests with. Sam, it’s a show-down. Will
you come through with the evidence I want, or
won’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t-you. We done talked that all out, Aleck.
I wisht you-all wouldn’t bother me if it’s not unconvenient
for you to let me alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He offered the officer a chew of tobacco to show
that he was not peevish about the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff waved the plug aside impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One of the boys can’t stand the gaff. He’s
breaking, Sam. But you’ve got a wife and a kid.
He hasn’t. I want you to have first chance. Come
clean and I’ll look out for you. After the trial I’ll
see you get out of the country quietly. You can
take your folks back to Texas.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sam looked out of the window. The little boat
and the jackknife hung limp in his hands. In a
cracked, falsetto voice he took up a song of the range
that he had hummed a hundred times in the saddle:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>

<p class='line0'>Rope in my hand and a cow by the tail.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>He thought of the rough and turbulent life that
had come at last to the peaceful shoals of happy
matrimony. A vision rose before him of his smiling
young wife and crowing baby. They needed him.
Must he give them up for a point of honour? If
someone was to go clear, why not he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have evidence enough. It isn’t that. I’m
giving you a chance, Sam. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lips of the Texan murmured another stanza,
but his thoughts were far afield:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never again, Sam. Not unless you take your
chance now.” The sheriff put a hand on his shoulder.
“For the sake of the wife and the little man.

<p class='pindent'>Matson said nothing. The Texan was building
up for himself a vision of the life he loved in the wind
and the sunshine of the open range. The old Chisum
Trail song he sung must bring to his memory a hundred
pictures of the past. These would be arguments
more potent than any the sheriff could use.</p>

<h3>“YOU DAMNED JUDAS”</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>N</span>OT for years had Shoshone County been so
interested in any public event as it was in
the trial of Rowan McCoy for the murder of
Dan Gilroy. Scores of ranchmen had driven in from
the hills to be present either as witnesses or spectators.
North of town was a camp with two chuck
wagons where the cattlemen kept open house for all
the range riders who had ridden down to Wagon
Wheel. A beef had been killed and a cook engaged.
Everybody was welcome to help himself. At the
opposite end of town the sheepmen also had a camp,
for the two small hotels were entirely inadequate to
hold those in attendance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sentiment of the people was strong for a conviction.
Rowan had many friends, and the cattle
interests were anxious to see him acquitted. But
the killing of Gilroy had been so unprovoked that
it had aroused a bitter and widespread resentment.
The feeling of those not involved in the cattle and
sheep war was that an example must be made.
Shoshone County had irrigated lands for sale. Its
oil fields were on the market for exploitation. Its
citizens were eager to prove to the world of investment
that the wild, turbulent days were past, that
Wyoming had arrived at a responsible sobriety
which would not tolerate lawlessness. Once for all
they meant to show the night raiders that they were
within reach of the courts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haight, the new district attorney, was a young
man, almost a stranger in the county, and he wanted
a record for convictions. Therefore he brought
McCoy to trial for the murder of Gilroy rather than
Tait. Gilroy had many friends and no personal
enemies. He was a quiet, peaceable man. Apparently
he had been shot while unarmed and trying
to escape. His killing had been wanton and unprovoked.
It might be claimed that Tait had always
wanted trouble and that he had been struck
down while firing at his enemies. But in the case of
Gilroy this plea would not stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The courtroom was crowded to the windows.
Two bailiffs stood at the door and searched every
man that entered; for the feeling was so intense
that the authorities did not want to take the chance
of any possible outbreak. A gun in a hip pocket was
too easy to reach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his opening statement the district attorney
told the story of the sheep and cattle war. He
traced the source of the bad feeling between the
prisoner and Tait, and showed that the bitterness
extended to Silcott and Falkner, two others charged
with this murder, one of whom had been wounded
and the other beaten up by the sheepman. The
prosecution would prove that both Silcott and
Falkner had made threats against Tait, that Falkner
had been seen to take a rifle from a ranch bunk house
in the dead of night, and that McCoy had led the
party which killed the two sheepmen. It was, he
claimed, immaterial to the case of the State whether
McCoy had or had not fired the shot that killed
Gilroy. He would introduce evidence tending to
show that the prisoner actually had fired the shot,
but his honour would tell the jury that this was not
necessary to prove guilt. The testimony would
show that McCoy with three of his companions
rode back to the Circle Diamond Ranch, pretended
to the housekeeper that they had spent the night
there, and after breakfast returned to the round-up
camp, burying on the way the rifle that Falkner had
been seen to take the night before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bit by bit, with the skill of the trained lawyer,
Haight used his witnesses to spin a web around the
accused man. He showed how, after the arrival
of Silcott at the camp the night before the raid,
McCoy decided unexpectedly to drive the Circle
Diamond cattle home and took with him Cole and
Silcott. Shortly afterward Rogers and Yerby had
departed with flimsy excuses. Falkner had stolen
away without any assigned reason. They had not
been seen again at camp until late next morning.
Hans Ukena, a rider for the Triangle Dot, testified
that he had been sleeping in the bunk house the night
in question and was wakened by a noise. By the
light of the moon he saw Falkner pass through the
open door, carrying a rifle in one hand and an ammunition
belt in the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interest grew tense when Sheriff Matson took
the stand. The big tanned Westerner made a first-class
witness. He gave his evidence with a quiet
confidence that carried weight. As he told the story
of how he had followed the trail of the raiders foot by
foot from the scene of the crime to the Circle Diamond
Ranch the hopes of the defense sank. For
the best part of a day he was put through a gruelling
cross-examination in an attempt to show that it
would have been impossible to identify hoofprints
and boot marks after they had been covered with
snow. Not once did he contradict or falter as to his
facts. He left the stand with the jury convinced
that he had told the plain truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had taken three days to select a jury and four
more to examine witnesses to date. Wagon Wheel
buzzed with gossip. The rumour would not down
that one of the prisoners had turned State’s evidence
and was to be put on the stand next morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wise curbstone prophet mentioned the names
of Silcott and Yerby. “It’s one of them sure.
Shouldn’t wonder if it’s both of them,” he announced
at the bar of the Silver Lode.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You got another guess,” interrupted a hillman
roughly. “I know ’em both. Won’t either of them
squeal. They’ll go through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all very well. But if McCoy dragged
them into this thing——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He didn’t. They’re not kids. If they went in
it was with their eyes open.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth, torn by conflicting emotions, had been
present with Mrs. Flanders all through the trial.
The testimony of Matson had left her shaken with
dread. She felt now that Rowan was guilty, and
she believed he would be convicted. But it was impossible
for her not to admire his courage under
fire. His nerve was so cool and steady, his frank
face so open and friendly. One might gather from
his manner that he was greatly interested, but not
at all anxious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately after court was declared in session
next morning, Haight turned to the bailiff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Call Larry Silcott.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A murmur swept like a wave through the courtroom.
Men and women craned their necks to see
the young cowman as he passed to the witness
stand. Ruth noticed that Larry’s face was gray and
that he kept his eyes on the floor. But even then
she had no premonition of what he was about to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Rowan knew. While Silcott answered nervously
the first routine questions of the lawyer, the
prisoner watched him steadily with a scornful little
smile. Rowan had taught him the practical side of
his business, had looked after his cattle, given him
his friendship. Once he had dragged him out of the
Fryingpan when he was drowning. His feeling for
the younger man was like that of an older brother.
He had felt an affectionate pride in his pupil’s skill
at roping and at riding. Now Larry, to save his own
skin, was betraying him and the rest of his companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haight was very gentle and considerate of his star
witness. But Silcott was in hell none the less.
Dry-lipped and pallid, with tiny sweat beads on
his damp forehead, he faced row upon row of tense,
eager faces all hanging on what he had to tell. Not
one of them all but would despise him. His stripped
and naked soul writhed, the vanity for once burned
out of him. He shivered with dread. It was being
driven into him that though he had bought his life
he must pay for his treachery with years of isolation
and contempt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prosecuting attorney led him over the story
of the night when he had ridden with the sheep
raiders. Step by step the witness took the party
from the round-up to the camp at Bald Knob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who had charge of your party?” continued
Haight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McCoy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you elect him leader?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He just took command. He was boss of
the round-up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who assigned you positions before the attack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McCoy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what order did he place you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Counting from the left, Cole, Yerby, Rogers,
myself, Falkner, McCoy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you show on the map just how you were
placed with reference to the camp and each other?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silcott took the pointer and illustrated the position
of each man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which of you was nearest the camp?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“McCoy was closer than the rest of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When was the first shot fired?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I judge we were about a hundred yards from the
wagons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did it come from the camp or was it fired by one
of your party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By one of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were any of the sheepmen then in sight?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it fired to draw them from cover so as to
get at them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief lawyer for the defense was on his feet
instantly with an objection. The court ruled the
question out of order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haight rose, took a step toward the witness, and
paused a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who fired that shot, Mr. Silcott?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry’s eyes went furtively about the room, met
those of McCoy, and dropped to the floor. “It—it
came from the right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the smoke and the sound.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you see who fired it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Falkner or McCoy; I wasn’t sure which.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Rowan’s lawyer objected and was sustained.
The judge cautioned the witness to tell only what he
knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silcott went over the story of the shooting of Tait
with great detail. The prosecuting attorney made
another dramatic pause to let the audience get the
significance of his next lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you where you could see Dan Gilroy when
he ran from the wagon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you tell exactly what happened when
Gilroy ran from the wagon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ran out from the back and started for the
brush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was he armed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Proceed. What happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He had run about thirty feet when somebody
fired. He fell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were any more shots fired?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. That was the last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From what direction did it come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From my right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By the sound and the smoke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did the smoke rise with relation to the
defendant?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silcott moistened his dry lips with his tongue.
He was sweating blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was close to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haight threatened him with his forefinger. “Won’t
you swear that the defendant fired that shot? Don’t
you know he fired it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I can’t swear to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Weren’t you convinced that it was McCoy
who——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defense objected angrily: “The witness has
answered the question. Is the prosecuting attorney
trying to bully him to change that answer?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When at last Haight was through with him the
witness dripped with perspiration. But his troubles
were only beginning. The lawyers for the defense
took him in hand, made him confess his obligations
to McCoy, brought out that he himself had proposed
the raid, and wrung from him that he was turning
State’s evidence to save his own life at the expense
of his friends. Two points they developed in favour
of their client—that he had repeatedly warned
his friends against shooting and that he had saved
the lives of the herders from Falkner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But though Silcott was left a rag, his story stood
the fire of cross-examination. When he stepped
down from the stand he left behind him a net of
evidence through which McCoy could not break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Larry moved down the aisle someone in the
back part of the room broke the silence: “You
damned Judas!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly echoes of the word filled the courtroom.
The judge pounded with his gavel for silence, but
that low-hissed “Judas! Judas!” pursued the young
cowman down the stairs. It would be many years
before he could recall without scalding shame that
moment when the finger of public scorn was pointed
at him in execration.</p>

<h3>A COMPROMISE</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>M</span>URDER in the first-degree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not a muscle of the prisoner’s face
moved as the clerk of the court read the
verdict. He gave no sign whatever of emotion.
Since Silcott’s testimony he had expected nothing
less. Now his grave eyes rested on the face of the
clerk with steady composure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The reporters, watching him for copy, would have
been disappointed if they had had to depend upon
him for it. But into the dead silence of the courtroom
was lifted the low, sobbing wail of a woman.
Ruth had collapsed into the ample bosom of Mrs.
Flanders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The face of the convicted man twitched, but he
did not look around. Without the evidence of his
eyes he knew who had broken down under the
strain, whose game will had weakened at the blow.
In that moment he thought wholly of her, not at all
of himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A grizzled old cattleman pushed his broad shoulders
through the crowd toward the condemned
raider. “This ain’t the end, boy. We’ll work like
sixty to get you a new trial. This will never go
through—never in the world!” His strong arm
fell with frank affection across the shoulders of his
friend. “It don’t matter what names they call
you, son. You’re the same old Mac to all of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is when a fellow finds out who his friends
are, Roswell,” answered Rowan simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had many of them. They rallied to him by
scores—long, loose-jointed, capable men with leathery
brown faces, men who had fought with him
against Wyoming blizzards for the lives of driven
cattle, men who had slept beside him under the same
tarp by many a campfire. From Rawlins and
Casper and Cheyenne, and even far-away Denver,
came words of good cheer. They stressed the point
that the fight for his life was just beginning and that
the verdict of the jury would not be accepted as
final.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A telegram from Pendleton, Oregon, touched him
deeply. It was signed by four bronco busters whom
he had beaten for the championship at Bad Ax:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>Stick to the saddle, Mac. Don’t you pull leather, old
scout. We’re here hollering our heads off for the best
rider that ever slapped a saddle on an outlaw. Clamp
your knees and hang on tight. Say, Mac, we got a little
pile of chips to shove into the game any time you’re shy
of blues.</p>

</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stovall, who had been a very unwilling
witness for the prosecution, brought a cake and a
cherry pie to the jail for him. Incidentally, she
delivered a message with which she had been commissioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Norma says for me to tell you that this trial
doesn’t fool her any. She knows you’re being
punished for some of the other boys. She wanted I
should tell you that she knows you didn’t intend to
kill Joe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was an opinion becoming every day more
widespread. Men began to say that McCoy was
the victim of evil chance. Shoshone County was
still determined to see justice done the murderers of
Dan Gilroy, but it hoped Rowan would escape the
gallows. He had been so game throughout the trial,
so careful to bring out nothing to the prejudice of
his fellow prisoners that the hearts of men turned
toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The financial side of the affair was troubling the
officials of the county. The trial had been a long and
expensive one. It had cost many thousand dollars,
and there was talk of grounds for an appeal. With
four other trials yet to come, it became apparent
that Shoshone County would be bankrupt long
before the finish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roswell, acting for a group of friends, went to the
prosecuting attorney.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look here, Haight. You’re up against it.
Maybe you’ve got evidence to convict these boys.
Maybe you haven’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s no maybe about that—I have,” Haight
broke in grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, say you have. That ain’t the point.
The county can’t stand the expense of all those
trials. You know that. What are you going to do
about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Going right ahead with the trials. We begin
with Brad Rogers to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, well! We got to be reasonable—all of us.
Now here’s my proposition: Let me talk with the boys
and their lawyers. If I could get them to plead
guilty it would save a heap of trouble all around.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Haight had looked at the matter from this angle
before. He nodded. “All right. See what you
can do, Mr. Roswell. If they will save us the expense
of trying them, I think I can arrange for life
imprisonment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For all of them?” demanded the cattleman
shrewdly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For all the rest of them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How about Rowan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not included. We’ve got to make an
example of him. He led the raid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roswell fought it out with the lawyer for an hour,
but on this point Haight stood firm. McCoy had
to pay the extreme penalty for his crime. That was
not even open to argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old cattleman called at once upon the leading
lawyer for the defense, and with him visited the cell
of Yerby. The Texan was greatly depressed at the
issue of the trial. He could not get over his bitterness
at the part Silcott had played.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon he’s up at the ho-tel eating fried chicken
and watermelon. Well, he’s welcome. I wouldn’t
swap places with him. Neither would Mac. We
all had our chance to do like he done.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Silcott’s still in jail. He asked Matson to
keep him there till the trials are over and he can
light out. I expect he don’t like to trust himself
outside. Some of the boys are a mite vexed at him.”
Roswell came abruptly to the object of his call.
“Sam, we got to face facts. Haight has the goods
on you boys. He’ll sure convict you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Looks like,” agreed the Texan dejectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll have to fix up a compromise. If you’ll all
plead guilty Haight is willing to call it life imprisonment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do the other boys say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are willing, I reckon, to take the best terms
they can get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d as lief be dead as locked up in jail for the rest
of my life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll get you out on parole in two or three years.
The worst of it is that Mac ain’t included in the
arrangement. Haight swears he has got to hang.”
Eyes narrowed to slits, Roswell watched the Texan
while he fired his next shot. “Mac was the leader.
There wouldn’t ’a’ been any killing except for him.
He’s the responsible party. So Haight says that——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Got it all figured out, have you? Mac did the
killing. Mac was to blame. I’ll tell you this: If
Mac had had his way there wouldn’t have been any
killing. Just because he shuts his mouth and stands
the gaff——&nbsp;Dog-gone it, you and Haight can
take yore compromise plumb to hell!” decided the
Texan, his anger rising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roswell gave a low whoop and fell upon him.
“That’s the way to talk, old-timer. We’ve got
Haight on the hip. The county’s busted high and
dry. Folks are beginning to holler already about
the expense of the trials. If Haight were to come
up for reëlection along with a special tax levy to pay
for the trials the dear pee-pul wouldn’t do a thing to
him. He’s ready to talk turkey. If you lads will
stand pat, it’s an even bet that he’ll have to crawfish
about Mac.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ’low we’ll stay hitched—all of us that haven’t
a big yellow streak up our backs. Why-for should
we let Mac get the worst of the deal? You go tell
Haight he can’t stack the cards that-a-way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rogers, coming up for trial next day, was anxious
to get the matter settled. But he, too, declined
the terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll take my chance before a jury unless Haight
agrees to lump Mac in with the rest of us. Mac
would see Haight in blazes before he would agree
to any such raw deal if he were in my place. You
can let Mr. Prosecuting Attorney start the fireworks
soon as he’s a mind to. I’m willing to go as far as I
can. I reckon all the boys are. But I’m too old
and tough and stubborn to whine out of it like Larry
Silcott. What’s sauce for the goose is sauce for
the gander. When I see Mac’s name at the head of
the list, I’ll sign a compromise.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cole and Falkner in turn were visited. The former
refused flatly to consider any arrangement which did
not include McCoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the interest of psychology or to satisfy his own
curiosity Roswell ventured on debatable ground
with Falkner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Course you don’t owe Mac anything. He led
you into this trouble. The whole thing is his fault.
Silcott as good as admitted that Rowan did the
actual killing himself. Naturally you would be
sore on him. Now by accepting Haight’s proposition
Mac will be hanged and you other lads——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mac will be hanged, will he?” growled Falkner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure thing. Nothing can save him if you accept
Haight’s terms. But, after all——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoner looked at the old cattleman blackly.
Whatever faults he had, Falkner was not a sneak.
McCoy had kept quiet when he might have told the
others who had done the killing. McCoy had stood
pat from start to finish. He had taken his share of
blame when he might fairly enough have shifted it
to other shoulders. If Mac had given the word,
it would have been Falkner who would have been
hanged while the others got off with prison sentences.
The young cow-puncher knew he was to blame for the
predicament in which they all stood. His ungovernable
rage at Tait was responsible for the killings.
Hard citizen though he was, the man was game to
the core.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who in Mexico wants to accept Haight’s offer?”
he snarled. “I’ve lived a wolf, by some folks’ way
of it. I reckon I’ll die one. But I’m no coyote.
Make another crack like that and there’ll be trouble
right here in Cell Fifteen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Roswell grinned. To the prosecuting attorney he
carried back word that his proffer had been rejected.
No compromise would be considered which did not
include McCoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hotel where Roswell and his friends stayed
became active as a hive of bees. From it cow-punchers
and cattlemen issued to make a quiet canvass
of the leading citizens of Shoshone County.
The result was that Haight and his political friends
were besieged for twelve hours by taxpayers who insisted
on a compromise being arranged. The long-distance
telephone called him up three times that
night to carry protests against his policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the idea, Haight?” asked a prominent
irrigation engineer in charge of a project under construction.
“We stand for the law. We want to see
every man punished that was in the sheep raid.
But there’s no object in starting trouble with the
cattlemen, and that’s what it will amount to if you
hang Rowan McCoy. Tait and Gilroy weren’t
blameless. They knew what they were going up
against. They didn’t have to cross the dead line
and ruin the ranchmen on the Fryingpan. A prison
sentence all around hits me as about right. I’ve
talked with lots of people, and that’s the general
sentiment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before Rogers was to be brought into the
courtroom for trial Haight gave way. He had a long
conference with the lawyers for the defense and
the presiding judge. As a result of this it was announced
that the prisoners would plead guilty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before sunset each of the five had been sentenced
to life imprisonment.</p>

<h3>FALKNER TALKS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>ITH the news that Rowan would not have
to pay with his life, Ruth’s anxiety took on
another phase. Their happiness had come
to grief. It was likely that the tentative separation
caused by her anger at his unfaithfulness would prove
to be a final one. But her imperative need was to
demand the truth about the sheep raid killings. At
the bottom of her heart was still a residuum of deep
respect for him. It was impossible to believe that
this clean, lean-flanked Westerner with the steadfast
eyes was a common murderer who had stolen up at
night to compass the death of his enemy from cover.
Moreover, there was a reason—a vital, urgent,
compelling one—why she must think the best she
could of the man she had married.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This reason took her to Sam Yerby’s cell at the
county jail. She and the Texan had struck up one
of the quick, instinctive friendships that were scattered
along Ruth’s pathway. They had a common
sense of humor. When she poked friendly fun
at his speech he did not resent it. The girl had
completed her conquest of him by taking a great
interest in Missie and the baby. She had embroidered
for the little fellow a dress which Sam
thought the daintiest in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tired eyes of the old cattleman lit when she
came to the door of his prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s right good of you, Miss Ruth, to come and
see the old man before he goes over the road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry, Mr. Yerby.” She choked up.
“But everybody tells me you won’t have to stay in
very long, and I’m going to look out for Missie and
Boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tears filmed his eyes. The muscles of the leathery
face worked with emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cain’t thank you, Miss Ruth, but I reckon
you know what I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Missie is going to teach Boy what a good man
his father is, and when you come out you and he will
be great friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded. Speech at that moment was beyond
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All the boys are going to look after your stock
just as if it belonged to them. They’ll take care of
your brand at the round-up and make the beef cut
for you just the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s right kind of them. I sure do feel grateful.”
He looked shyly at his visitor. Sam knew
that all was not well between her and Rowan. “What
about you, Miss Ruth? You-all are losing a better
man than Missie ever had. He’s a pure, Mac is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her live eyes fixed themselves on him. “There’s
something I want to know, Mr. Yerby—something
I have a right to know. It’s—it’s about the sheep
raid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you-all go to Mac and ask him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been to him. He wouldn’t tell me; said he
couldn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A puzzled expression of doubt lifted his eyebrows.
“I don’t reckon I can tell you then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to tell me. I’ve a right to know.
I’m going to know.” She said it with an imperious
little accent of feminine ferocity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O’ course in regards to what took place——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you start that night intending to kill Joe
Tait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am, we didn’t. Rowan told the boys
time and again there wasn’t to be any killing. He
planned it so it wouldn’t be necessary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then how was it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell you this much: Someone went out of his
haid and began shooting. Inside of three minutes
it was all over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did—did Rowan kill either of them?” she
whispered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know who killed Tait. Several of the
boys were firing. Mac didn’t kill Gilroy. I’m ’most
sure of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not dead sure,” she insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m what you might call morally certain. But
there’s one man can set yore mind at rest, if you can
get him to talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hal Falkner. He knows who started the shooting
and who killed Dan Gilroy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve hardly met him. Do you think he would
tell me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe he would.” He smiled a little. “I
notice you mostly get yore way. Hal’s rough-and-ready.
Don’t you mind it if he acts gruff. That’s
just his way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll go see him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon it won’t do any harm. But I can tell
you one thing, anyhow. If you give Mac the benefit
of all the doubts, it will be about what’s right. He
saved the herders from Falkner. Silcott testified
to that. Before Gilroy was shot I heard yore husband
holler to stop firing. Now wouldn’t it be onreasonable
to figure that he gunned Dan himself
right away? If Mac wouldn’t tell you-all what
happened it was because we had all made a solemn
agreement not to talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think that is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shorely do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An’, Miss Ruth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Yerby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated before he made the plunge. “I
won’t see you-all again for a long time, maybe never.
You’re young and proud and high-heeled, like
you-all got a perfect right to be. But I want to say
this: If you live to be a hundred, yo’ll never meet
any one that’s more of a man than Rowan McCoy.
He’s white clear through. I’ve seen a right smart of
men in my time. Most o’ them had a streak of lean
and a streak of fat, as the old saying goes. But yore
husband, he assays ’way up all the time. Good luck
or bad makes no difference with him. He’s the real
stuff.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A wistful little smile touched her face. “He has
one good friend, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He has hundreds. He deserves them, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to say good-bye now, Mr. Yerby.”
She gave him both hands. Tears blurred her eyes
so that she could scarcely see him. “Good-bye.
Heaps of luck—oh, lots of it! And don’t worry
about Missie and Boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not worry half so much now, little friend.
And I’m hoping all that luck will come to you, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Sheriff Matson Ruth secured a permit to
see Falkner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cow-puncher was brought, hand-cuffed, into
the office of the jailer. It was an effect of his sudden,
furious temper that his guards never took any
chances with him. None of the friendly little
privileges that fell to the other prisoners came his
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. McCoy wants to talk with you, Hal,”
explained Ackerman, the jailer. “Don’t make any
mistake about this. I’ll be in the outer room there
with a gat. I’ve got a guard under the window.
This is no time to try for a get-away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner looked at him with an ugly sneer. “Glad
you mentioned it, Steve. I’ll postpone any notions
I may have in that line, but, take it from me, they
are merely postponed. When the time comes I’m
going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ackerman shrugged his shoulders and left the
room. He thought it altogether likely that some day
Falkner would have the top of his head blown off,
but he did not want to have to do the job.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve come to ask a favour of you, Mr. Falkner,”
Ruth blurted out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her courage was beginning to ebb. The man
looked so formidable now that she was alone with
him. His reputation, she knew, was bad. More
than once, when she had met him on horseback in
the hills, the look in his burning black eyes had sent
little shivers through her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A favour of me, Mrs. McCoy! Ain’t that a
come-down? Didn’t know you knew I was on the
map. You’re sure honouring me,” he jeered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was his habit to take note in his sullen fashion
of all good-looking women. When he had seen her
about the ranch or riding with her husband or Larry
Silcott he had resented it that this slender, vivid
girl who moved with such quick animal grace, whose
parted lips and shining eyes were so charmingly
eager, had taken him in apparently only as a detail
of the scenery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now his dark eyes, set deep in the sockets, narrowed
suspiciously. What did she want of him?
What possible favour was there that he could give
her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to know about the Bald Knob raid,” she
hurried on. “Maybe I oughtn’t to come to you.
I don’t know. But I’ve got to know the truth of
what happened that night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you go to your husband, then?”
he demanded. “Mac knows as much about it as I
do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went to him. He wouldn’t tell me; said it
wouldn’t be right to tell anything he knew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That so?” From his slitted eyelids he watched
her closely, not at all certain of what was her game.
“Then if it wouldn’t be right for Mac to tell you,
it wouldn’t be right for me, would it?” The strong
white teeth in his coffee-brown face flashed in a mocking
grin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was before the trial. Mr. Yerby said
he wouldn’t talk then because you had agreed not
to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! So you’ve been to Yerby?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. He couldn’t tell me what I want to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what is it you want to know particularly?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know what Mr. Silcott testified about—about
where the shooting started from and about
where the shot came from that killed Mr. Gilroy. I
want you to tell me that it wasn’t Rowan fired those
shots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He considered her a moment warily, his mind
loaded with suspicions. Was this a frame-up of some
sort? Was she trying to trap him into admissions
that would work against him later?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the trial is past now. Mac can talk if he
wants to. Why don’t you go to him?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d rather you would tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He grinned. “Nothing doing to-day, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Falkner met one of the surprises of his life.
Fire flashed from this slim slip of a girl. Her eyes
attacked him fearlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You wouldn’t dare say that if you and Rowan
were free,” she blazed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He let slip a startled oath. “That’s right. I
wouldn’t.” The cow-puncher laughed hardily. He
could afford to make this admission. Nobody had
ever questioned his courage. “All right, ma’am.
Objection sustained, as the judge said when Haight
kicked on any answer to one of his fool questions.
I’ll take back that ‘my dear.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will you tell me what I want to know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s another proposition. You got to give me
better reasons than you have yet why I should.
Do you reckon I’m going to put my cards down on
the table while you pinch yours up close? What’s
the game? What are you aiming to do with what I
tell you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. I just want to know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little wave of pink beat into her cheeks. “I
don’t want—if I can help it—to think of my husband
as—as a——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A murderer. Is that it?” he flung at her brutally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded her head twice. The word hit her, in
his savage voice, like a blow in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why don’t you ask Mac? Are you afraid
he’d lie to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know he wouldn’t,” she answered with spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then?” He watched her with hard eyes,
still doubtful of her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m his wife. Isn’t it natural I should want to
know the truth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What are you trying to put over on me? Why
don’t you go to Mac and ask him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She threw herself on his mercy. “We—we’ve
quarrelled. I can’t go to him. There’s nobody else
to tell me but you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were dark shadows under the big eyes in
the colourless face. She had suffered, he guessed,
during these last weeks as she never had before.
Life had taken toll of her pride and her gaiety. She
looked frail and spent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in the dreariness of her stricken youth
touched him. He spoke more gently:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“According to Silcott’s story it lies between me
and Mac. If he didn’t fire those shots, I did. Do
you reckon I’m going to tell you that he didn’t
fire them? Why should I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes fell full in his. “Because I’m entitled
to know the truth. I’m in trouble and you can help
me. You’re no Larry Silcott. You’re a man. You
stood firm at the risk of your life. Even if it is at
your own expense, you’ll tell me. Rowan would do
as much for your wife if you had one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth had said the right word at last, had in two
sentences touched both his pride and his gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon that beats me, ma’am,” he said. “I
owe Mac a lot, and I’ll pay an installment of it
right now. Yore husband never fired his gun from
start to finish of the Bald Knob raid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light in her eyes thanked him more than words
could have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While I’m at it I’ll tell you more,” he went on.
“Mac laid the law down straight that we weren’t
gunning for Tait. He didn’t want to take me along
because he knew I was sore at the fellow, but when
I insisted on going the others overruled him. After
the killing Mac never once said ‘I told you so’ to the
others for letting me go along. What’s more, when
they asked questions about who killed Gilroy and
who started the shooting, he gave them no satisfaction.
He let the boys guess who did it. If Mac had
said the word, the rest would have rounded on me.
I would have been hanged, and they would have got
short sentences. Your husband is a prince, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got him and the other boys into all this trouble.
He hasn’t flung it up to me once. What do you know
about that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so glad I came to see you. It’s going to
make a great difference to me.” There was a tremor
in her voice that told of suppressed tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ackerman came to the door: “About through?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoner lifted his upper lip in a sneer. “Better
throw your gat on me, Steve. I might make trouble,
you know.”</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h3>RUTH WHISPERS A SECRET</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>CKERMAN followed Rowan into the sheriff’s
office. Matson looked up from the desk
where he was working.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right, Steve. You needn’t wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he had signed his name to the letter he was
writing, Matson turned to his prisoner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re going to start on the eleven-thirty, Mac.
Your wife is down at the house with Mrs. Matson.
She wants to say good-bye there instead of at the
depot. I’ve got considerable business to clean up
before train time, so I’ll stay on the job. Be back
here in an hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean that I’m to go there alone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? I’ll ask you to go through the alleys
if you don’t mind. I don’t want the other boys to
feel that I’m playing favourites.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll not forget this, Aleck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sho! You never threw a man down in your life,
Mac. I don’t reckon you’re going to begin now.
Hit the dust. I’m busy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan crossed the square to a street darkened by
shade trees, and followed it to the alley. Down
this he passed between board fences. He took his
hat off and lifted his face to the star-strewn sky.
It would be many years before he walked again a
free man beneath the Milky Way. Society was putting
him behind bars because he had broken its laws.
He did not dispute the justice of its decision. His
punishment was fair enough. When he and his
friends decided to be a law to themselves, to right one
wrong by doing another, they had laid themselves
open to blame. A man must be held responsible
for his actions, even when the result is different from
what he anticipates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind his self-containment McCoy was suffering
poignantly. He was on his way to say good-bye to
the girl wife he loved. It was his conviction that
when he emerged from the shadow now closing in
upon him Ruth would have passed out of his life.
Already she had wearied of what he had to offer.
There was no likelihood that she would waste her
young years waiting for a man shut up in prison for
his misdeeds. Far better for her to cut loose from
him as soon as possible. He intended to advise
her to sell the ranch, realize what she could in cash
from it, and then file an action for divorce. The
law would operate to release her almost automatically
from a convict husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Matson met him at the back door. She led
the way to a living room and stood aside to let him
pass in. Then she closed the door behind him, shutting
herself out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parlour was lit only by shafts of moonlight
pouring through the windows. Ruth stood beside
the mantel. She wore a white dress that had always
been a favourite of Rowan’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither of them spoke. He noticed that she was
trembling. From out of the darkness where she
stood came a strangled little sob.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan took the distance between them in two
strides. He gathered her into his arms, and she hid
her face against his woollen shirt. She wept, clinging
to him, one arm tight about his neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He caressed her hair softly, murmuring the sweetheart
words his thoughts had given her through all
the days of their separation. Not for many years
had he been so near tears himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently the sob convulsions that shook her
slight body grew less frequent. She dabbed at her
eyes with a lace handkerchief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve not been a good wife to you, Rowan,” she
whispered at last. “You don’t know how sometimes
I’ve—hated you—and distrusted you. I’ve thought
all sorts of bad things about you, and some of them
aren’t true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His arms tightened. The wild desire was in him
to hold her against the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I flirted with Larry Silcott,” she confessed. “I
did it to—to punish you. I’ve been horrid. But I
loved you all the time. Even while I hated you I
loved you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood sang through his veins. “Why did you
hate me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I can’t tell you that. Not yet; some day
maybe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it something I did?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y-yes. But I don’t want to talk about that now.
They’re going to take you away from me. We’ve
only got a few minutes. Oh, Rowan, I don’t see
how I’m going to let you go!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His heart overflowed with tenderness and pride.
Every one of her broken little endearments filled
him with joy. Her dear sweetness was balm to his
wounded soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let me tell you this, Ruth. I’m happier to-night
than I’ve been for a long time. They can’t separate us
if we keep each other in our hearts. I thought I’d lost
you. I’ve been through hell because of it, my dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You do—love me,” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did not try to tell her in words how much.
His reassurance was in the lovers’ language of eyes
and lips and the soft touch of hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came again to the less perfect medium of
words, and she told him of her visits to Yerby and
Falkner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I knew all the time you couldn’t have done what
Mr. Haight said you did; ’way down deep in my
heart I knew it. But I wanted to hold a grudge
against you because you didn’t confide in me. I
wanted to think bad things about you, and yet they
made me so dreadfully unhappy, Rowan. And all
the time you were sacrificing yourself for the man
who brought you into the trouble. I might have
known it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “No, honey. I wasn’t
doing any more than I had to do. We were all
partners in the raid. What one did all did. I’ve
had plenty of time to think it out, and I know that
I’m just as guilty as Falkner. We ought never to
have ridden on the raid. If I had set myself against
it, the others would have given it up. But I led
them. I’m responsible for what happened. So I
couldn’t throw Falkner down just because he was the
instrument. That wouldn’t have been square.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t agree with you at all. If he had done as
you said there wouldn’t have been any lives lost.
They’ve no right to hold you for it, and I’m going
to begin working right away to get you out. I went
to school with the governor’s wife, you know. They
have just been married—oh, scarcely a year. He’s a
lot older than she is and very much in love with
her, Louise says. So she’ll make him give you a
pardon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan smiled. “I’m afraid it isn’t going to be
so easy as that, dear. The governor couldn’t pardon
me on account of public opinion even if he wanted to
do it. I know him. He’s a good fellow. But the
Bald Knob raid has made too big a stir for him to
interfere now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s got to. I’ll show you. I want you home.”
She broke down and sought again the sanctuary of
his shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While she cried he petted her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a time she began to talk in whispered fragments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going to need you so much. I can’t stand
it, Rowan, to have you away from me now. I want
my man. I want you—oh, I want you so badly!
It isn’t fair. It isn’t right—now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in her voice startled him. He took
her by the shoulders and held her gently from him
while he looked into her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She broke from his hands and clung to him. He
knew her secret now. His heart beat fast as he
held her in his strong arms. Joy, exultation, humility,
fear, infinite tenderness—he tasted them all.
But the emotion that remained was despair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had forfeited his right to protect and cherish
her in her hour of need. She must go through the
dark valley of the shadow alone, while he was shut
up away from her. What kind of a husband had he
been ever to let himself be put in such a position?
All his strength and capacity would go for nothing.
Because of his folly, her inexperience, her fragile
youth would have to face the world unprotected,
and even these were to be handicapped by the new
life on the way. With what generous faith had she
given herself into his keeping, and how poorly had he
requited her! That very night he must take the
journey at the end of which he was to be buried alive,
must turn his back on her and leave her to make the
fight alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He groaned. Ruth heard him murmur, “My
love! My precious lamb!” She read the burning
misery in his eyes. Womanlike, she flew to comfort
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad—oh, you don’t know how glad I am—now
that we are <span class='it'>tillicums</span> again! I wouldn’t have
it any other way, Rowan. If it weren’t for what’s
going to happen—I couldn’t stand it to wait for you.
Don’t you see? I’ll have a pledge of you with me
all the time. When I’m loving it, I’ll be loving you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What she said was true. There had been forged
a bond irrevocable between them. He recognized it
with a lifted heart. The cross-current of fate that
was snatching him from her must at last yield to the
sweep of the tide that would bring them together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve made my plans,” she went on. “I know
just what I’m going to do—if you’ll let me. I want
to go back to the ranch and run it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m afraid that isn’t possible. This trial has
cost me a lot of money. I’m mortgaged and in debt.
Besides, ranching takes expert knowledge. It’s
doubtful whether I could have held the ranch, anyhow.
The government is creating forest reserves
up in the hills. That will cut off the free range.
Sheep are pushing in, and they’ll get what is left.
We’d better sell out and save for you what little we
can. It won’t be much, but if the stock brings a
good price it will be something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please, Rowan. I want so much to try it,” she
pleaded. “I haven’t ever been any help to you—thought
of nothing but having a good time. You
were too good to me—let me spend far more money
than I ought. You see, I didn’t realize how hard
up you were. But now I’m going to be such a tiptop
manager, if you’ll only let me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would, dear—if it were any use,” he told her
gently. “But you would have all your worry for
nothing. The new conditions make the old ways
impossible. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her coaxing smile refused to accept his decision.
“My aunt left me her money, you know. I don’t
know how much it is yet. Most of it is property
that must be sold. But I can use it when it comes
to save the ranch. I’d love to. I want to be helping
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ask Tim Flanders if I’m not right, sweetheart.
He has a level head. He’ll tell you just what I’m
telling you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. I’ll ask him. We don’t need to decide
my future now. There will be lots of time after
you have gone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan drew her to a chair, and sat down with her
in his arms. For once his tongue was not tied. The
ten minutes that were left he packed full of all the
love that had so long been waiting in his heart for
expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she said good-bye to him it was with a wan,
twitchy little smile on her face. But as soon as he
was out of the room she flung herself down, weeping,
beside the lounge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was still lying crouched there when McCoy
climbed to the vestibule of the through train. He
moved awkwardly because his left wrist was shackled
to the right one of Cole.</p>

<h3>AT THE CIRCLE DIAMOND</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>R</span>OWAN’S decision to sell the ranch was on the
face of it a wise one. Ruth recognized this.
She knew nothing of cattle, nothing of farming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she told herself she could learn. Her interest
was very greatly engaged in saving the Circle Diamond
for Rowan. Other women had done well
homesteading. She knew one widow who raised
cattle, another who made money on sheep. Why
should she not do the same? It was all very well to
say that she had no business experience, but she had
as much as other people had when they began. If
she did not succeed, the failure would hurt her rather
than Rowan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She talked it all over with Flanders, a long-headed
business man who knew cattle from hoof to horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The cattleman sure has his troubles aplenty,”
he told her. “Short summers, long winters, deep
snows, blizzards, bad roads, heavy railroad rates, a
packers’ trust to buck, drought, and now sheep. A
cowman has got to bet before the draw; he can’t ever
tell whether he’s going to finish with a hand all blue
or a busted flush.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but I’ve heard you say yourself that cattle-raising
used to be a gamble and that from now on it’s
going to be a business instead,” she reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took off his big white hat and rubbed a polka-dot
handkerchief over his bald head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tha’s right, too. Government reports show
there’s several million fewer cattle in the country
than there was five years ago. That spells good
prices. There’s a good side to this forest-reserve
business, too. It keeps the range from being overcrowded,
and it settles the sheep and cattle war.
I’ve got a hunch there would be money in leasing the
range and putting cattle to run on it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then?” she demanded triumphantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That ain’t saying <span class='it'>you</span> could make money. Jennings
is a good foreman, but it takes a boss to run
any shebang right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the boss is in doubt she could telephone to
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth always had been a favourite of Flanders’s.
It pleased him that he could help her in her affairs,
and it flattered him to think that he could help her
make a success of the Circle Diamond. The conspiracy
she proposed intrigued his interest. She had
some money. Why not use it to save the ranch for
Rowan? Why not let her have the pleasure of showing
her husband later how well she had done in his
absence? It would give a zest to her life that would
otherwise be lacking. Moreover, it would be another
tie to bind her to McCoy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He yielded to the temptation, fell into her plans,
grew eager over them. There was a good deal of
sympathy for her in the country, so that she had little
difficulty in securing a permit for her cattle to range
on the reserve at the usual price.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a letter, Ruth wrote her husband that Flanders
thought it better not to sell out just yet, but she gave
no details of what she was doing in a business way.
She left him to gather that they were watching their
chance to get a good figure for the place. There was,
she felt, no use worrying him about the venture she
was making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her interest in the ranch developed amazingly.
Jennings was an experienced cattleman and devoted
to Rowan. It had been his curt opinion that McCoy
was a fool for marrying this feather-footed girl from
the East. Her gaiety and extravagance had annoyed
him. The flirtation with Silcott had set him flatly
against her. But now he began to revise his estimate.
He liked the eagerness with which she flung
herself into this exciting game of saving the Circle
Diamond. He liked the deference she paid his judgment,
and he admired the courage with which once
or twice she decided flatly against him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dinged if she ain’t got more sense than half the
men you meet!” chuckled the foreman on one occasion
when her verdict had proved more discriminating
than his advice. “The little boss done right
not to take that Cheyenne bid for the dogies.” He
did not know that it was really Flanders who was
responsible for vetoing the sale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were hours, of course, when the loneliness
of her life swept over Ruth in waves, when she fought
desperately for a footing against despair. It was her
inheritance to tread the hilltops or the valleys rather
than the dusty road. But in general she was almost
happy. A warm glow flushed her being when she
thought of Rowan. Some sure voice whispered to
her that however long he might be kept from her the
flame of love would burn bright in his heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had sinned against her pride and self-esteem,
and she had forgiven him. He had brought to her
trouble and distress by breaking the law of the land.
All her Eastern friends pitied her. They pelted her
with letters beginning, “Poor dear Ruth.” But she
refused to feel humiliated. Rowan was Rowan,
the man she loved, no matter what wrong he had
done. There burned bright in him a dynamic spark
of self-respect that would never be quenched. She
clung to this. She never let herself doubt it now,
even though one memory of him still stung her to
shame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth was coming through storm to her own. A
shock, a sorrow, a sin that by reason of its consequence
cuts to the quick—any of these may lead to
spiritual crises resulting in a convulsively sudden
soul birth. But growth is slow, imperceptible. The
young wife had lived for her own pleasure. Now
the self was being burned out of her. She came to
her new life with humility, with a steadfast purpose,
with self-abnegation no less real because it brought
to her a great and quiet joy. For the first time in
her life she lived with another in view rather than
herself. It would be long before she could move in
a universe of peace and serenity, but at least she was
on the road to self-mastery.</p>

<h3>SILCOTT DISCOVERS HE IS NOT WELCOME</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>R</span>UTH lay snuggled up on the lounge in her
sewing room, one foot tucked comfortably
under her, half a dozen soft pillows piled
at her back. She was looking rather indolently over
the two days’ old Wagon Wheel <span class='it'>Spoke</span> to see if it
gave any beef quotations. The day had been a
busy one. In the morning she had ridden across
to Pine Hollow to inspect a drift fence. Later she
had come home covered with dust after watching the
men fan oats. Getting out of her serviceable khaki,
she had revelled in a hot bath and put on a loose
morning gown and slippers. To-night she was content
to be lazy and self-indulgent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A leaded advertisement caught and held her eye.
It was on the back page and boxed to draw more
attention:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>The Open A N C Ranch, together with all cattle
and personal property pertaining thereto, is offered
for sale by me at a figure much below its
value to an immediate purchaser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall be at the ranch, ENTIRELY UNARMED,
for a week beginning next Monday.
Prospective buyers may see me there.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>LAWRENCE SILCOTT</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman read the announcement with
contemptuous interest. She had expected Silcott
to leave the country. It was not to be looked for
that a man weak enough to betray his friends would
run the risk of living in the neighbourhood of those
who had suffered from his treachery. At the two
capitalized words she smiled bitterly. They were
both a confession and a shield of defense. They
admitted fear, and at the same time disarmed the
righteous anger of his former neighbours. Ruth
conceded the shrewdness of his policy, even while
her pluck despised the spirit that had dictated it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inevitably she compared him with Rowan. Her
imagination pictured McCoy as he had sat through
the strain of the trial—cool, easy, undisturbed, master
of whatever fate might be in store for him. She
saw in contrast Silcott, no longer graceful and debonair,
smiles and gaiety all wiped out, a harried, irritable
wretch close to collapse. It was the first
time she had ever seen two men’s souls under the acid
test. One had assayed pure gold; the other a base
alloy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why? What was the difference between them?
Both had lived clean, hard lives in the open. Neither
of them had spurred their nerves with alcohol
or unduly depressed them with overmuch tobacco.
Externally both of them were fine specimens of the
genus man. But in crisis one had crumpled up,
his manhood vanished; the other had quietly stood
his punishment. The distinction between them was
that one had character and the other lacked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet all these years Silcott had been accepted in the
community as a good fellow. His showy accomplishments,
his shallow good looks, and his veneer of
friendliness had won a place for him. Ruth was
deeply ashamed that she had let him go as far with
her as he had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her thoughts went back to Rowan. They never
wandered very long from him these days. He was
the centre of her universe, though he was shut up
behind bars in a dingy prison. She knew she was
not responsible for the thing he had done, but she
reproached herself that she had not been a greater
comfort to him in the dark days and nights of trial.
She had thought of herself, of her grievances, too
much; not enough of him and his needs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No, that was not true. He had been in her mind
enough, but she had not been able to forget the
treason to love in which he had involved himself.
It had risen like a barrier between them every time
she had wanted to let him know how much she
suffered with him. There was something about it
almost unforgiveable, something that struck at the
very roots of faith and confidence and hope. It
negatived everything she had believed him to be,
since it proved that he could not be the man she had
so tremendously admired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even now she would not let herself think of it if
she could help. She thrust the memory back into
the unused chambers of her mind and tried to forget.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What she wanted to see in Rowan, what she always
did see except for this one incongruous aspect, was
what others saw, too, the fineness and the strength
of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some sound on the porch outside attracted her
attention. A loose plank creaked. It seemed to her
she heard the shuffling of furtive feet. Then there
was silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth sat up. The curtains were drawn, so that
she could not see out without rising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fingers fumbled at the latch of the French window
she had had made. She was not afraid, but she felt
a curious expectant thrill of excitement. Who could
be there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly the casement opened. A man’s head
craned forward. Eyes searched the room warily
and found the young woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth rose. “You—here!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Larry Silcott put his finger to his lips, came in,
and closed the window carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you want?” demanded the girl, eyes
flashing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man looked haggard and miserable. All his
gay effrontery had been wiped out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to see you—to talk with you,” he pleaded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about?” Her manner was curt and uncompromising.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want to explain. I want to tell you how it was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that necessary?” asked Ruth, her scornful eyes
full on him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I don’t want you to blame me. You
know how—how fond I am of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She threw out a contemptuous little gesture.
“Please spare me that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be hard on me, Ruth. Listen. They
had the goods on us. We were going to hang—every
one of us. They kept at me day and night.
They pestered me—woke me out of my sleep to argue
and explain. If it hadn’t been me it would have been
one of the others that gave evidence for the State.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s true. Both Haight and Matson told me so.
The only question was who would come through
first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If that was the only question for you, then it
shows just what you are. Did you never hear of
such things as honour and decency and fair play? If
anybody was entitled to the benefit of State’s evidence
it should have been the married men, poor
Sam Yerby or Mr. Rogers. They have children
dependent on them. Anybody with the least generosity
could see that. But you’re selfish to the core.
You never think of anybody but yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can you say that when you know that I
love you, Ruth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her eyes blazed. “Don’t say that. Don’t dare
say it,” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s true.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing of what you say is true. You don’t
know the truth when you see it. They picked you,
Haight and Matson did, because they knew you had
no strength or courage. Do you suppose that the
others didn’t get a chance to betray their friends, too?
All of them did. Every one of them. But they
were <span class='it'>men</span>. That was the difference. So the prosecution
focused on you. And you weakened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? I didn’t kill Tait or Gilroy. Why
should I be hanged for it? I wasn’t guilty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are as guilty as Rowan was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dunno about that. He shot Gilroy, if Falkner
didn’t,” Silcott said sulkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never! Never in the world!” she cried. “Don’t
tell me so, you cowardly Judas!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can talk. That’s easy. But you’ve never
had a rope round your neck. You’ve never awakened
in the night from a dream where they were taking
you out to hang you. You’ve never been hounded
till your nerves were ragged and you wanted to
scream out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t care to discuss all that. You had no
business to come here. You made your choice to
save yourself. That was your privilege, just as it is
mine to prefer never to see you again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice rose. “Why do you say that? I’m not
a leper. I’m still Larry Silcott, your friend. Say
I did wrong. Don’t you suppose I’ve paid? Don’t
you suppose I’ve lived in hell ever since? Have I
got to spend all the rest of my life an outcast?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would not let herself sympathize with his
wretchedness. He had betrayed the man she loved,
had struck at his life. The harsh judgment of youth
condemned him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You should have thought of that before you sold
out the men who trusted you,” she told him coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t sell them out. I didn’t get a penny for
it. I told the truth. That’s all,” he cried wildly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had forfeited the right to tell the truth.
And you did sell them out. You wouldn’t be here
to-night if you hadn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silcott shifted his defense. “I’m sick and tired
of things to-night, Ruth. Let’s not quarrel,” he
begged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not quarrelling. I don’t quarrel with any
one except my friends, and I’m trying to make it
clear that Mr. Lawrence Silcott is not one of them.
You are not welcome here, sir. I ask you to leave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you chuck your friends overboard when they
make one mistake? Don’t you ever give them a
second chance?” he appealed. “Can’t you make
any allowance for circumstances? I was sick all the
time I was in jail. They took advantage of me. I
never would have done it if I’d been <span class='it'>well</span>. You’ve
got to believe me, Ruth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Maybe it’s true. I hope so.” In spite of herself
she was touched by his misery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to forgive me, Ruth. I—oh, you
don’t know what I’ve been through!” He broke
down and brushed his hand across his eyes. “I
haven’t slept for a week. It’s been hell every hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better go away somewhere,” she suggested.
“Leave your affairs with an agent. You ought not
to stay here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. My nerves are all jumpy. I’ve got to get
away.” He took a long breath and plunged on:
“I’m going to begin all over again in Los Angeles or
San Francisco. I’ve had my lesson. I’ll run straight
from now on. I’m going to work hard and get ahead.
If you’d only stand by me, Ruth. If you’d——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t be a friend of the man who betrayed my
husband, if that’s what you mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d have to choose between him and me.
That’s true. Well, Rowan is in the penitentiary for
life. You’re young. You can’t wait for ever. It
wouldn’t be right you should. Besides, you and
Rowan never did get along well. I’m not saying
a word against him, but——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better not!” she flamed, the lace on her
bosom rising and falling fast with her passionate
anger. “You say he is in the penitentiary. Who
put him there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t the point, Ruth. Hear me out. You
can get free from him without any trouble. The
law says that a convict’s wife can get a divorce any
time——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want a divorce. I’d rather be his wife,
if he stays in prison for ever, than be married to any
other man on earth. I—I never heard such insolence
in my life. I’ve a good mind to call the men
to throw you off the place. Every moment you stay
here is an insult to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He moistened his parched lips with the tip of his
tongue. “There is no use getting excited, Ruth.
I came here because I love you. If you’d only be
reasonable. Listen. I’m going to California. If
you change your mind and want to come out
there——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth marched past him and flung the door open.
She turned on him eyes that blazed. “If you’re not
gone in five seconds, I’ll turn the men loose on you.
They’ve been aching for a chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His vanity withered before her wrath. For the
moment he saw himself as she saw him, a snake in the
grass, hateful to all decent human beings. It was
a moral certainty that she would keep her word and
call the Circle Diamond riders. What they would
do to him he could guess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went without another word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently she heard him galloping down the road
and out of her life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The anger died out of Ruth almost instantly.
She was filled with a sense of desolating degradation.
There had been a time in her life when she had put
this weakling before Rowan, when her laughter and
her friendliness had been for him instead of for the
man to whom she was married. He had never of
course been anything vital to her life, never one
hundredth part as important to her as Rowan. Indeed,
she had used him as an instrument with which
to punish her husband. But the fact remained that
she had offered him her friendship, had in resentment
flirted with him and skirted the edge of sex emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feeling that flooded her now was almost a
physical nausea.</p>

<h3>AN EXPLANATION</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>S Tim Flanders had predicted, the establishment
of government forest reserves
changed the equation that faced the cattleman.
The open range was doomed, but federal supervision
brought with it compensations. One of these
was that the man who ran cattle on the reserve need
not fear overstocking nor the competition of “Mary’s
Little Lamb.” The market was in a better condition
than it had been for years. The price of beef
was high, and was still on the rise. Nor was there
any prospect of a slump, since the supply in the
country was not equal to the demand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth had every reason to feel satisfied. Her shipment
of beef steers had brought a top price at the
Denver stockyards. The opportune sale of a house
from her aunt’s estate made it possible for her to
pay the debts that had accumulated from Rowan’s
trial and to reduce a little the mortgage on the Circle
Diamond. The hay-cutting in the meadow had run
to a fair average, and already she had in one hundred
acres of winter wheat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had worked hard and steadily, so that when
one afternoon Jennings brought back from the post
office a letter from Rowan his young mistress decided
to ride up into the hills and read it where she could
be alone among the pines. An earned holiday is a
double delight. As the pinto—one that Rowan
himself had gentled for his bride—picked his way
into the cañon mouth through blue-spiked larkspur
and rabbit bush in golden splashes the girl in the
saddle was nearer happy than she had been for many
a day. Her lover’s letter lay warm against her
breast, all the joy of reading it still before her. The
sky was blue as babies’ eyes except where a shoal of
mackerel clouds floated lazily westward. A meadow-lark
throbbed out its full-throated bliss. Robins
and bluebirds exulted in the sunshine. Already the
quivering leaves of a grove of young, quaking asps
that marched up from the trail to the rock wall were
golden with the touch of autumn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a pine grove on a sunny slope Ruth read his
letter, the tessellated light all about her in warm,
irregular patterns. To read what he had written
was to see the face of love. It filled her with deep
joy, brought with it a peace that was infinitely comforting.
She wept a little over it thankfully, though
every word carried good cheer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was allowed to write only once a week, and
everything he sent out was censored. But each
letter told her a little more than she had known
before of the man she had married. When she had
vowed to cleave to him through good and ill fortune
he had been a stranger to her. In some ways he still
was, just as no doubt she was to him. For underneath
the tricks of manner that had charmed him
and captured his imagination, what had he discerned
of the real woman sleeping in her? As for Ruth, she
had married Rowan because of her keenness for the
great adventure, Life, of which she supposed love
to be a large part.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been a little cross to her that he was uneducated
in the schools, that he could not parrot the
literary patter to which she was accustomed. He
spoke and he wrote fairly correctly. Once he had
surprised her by a reference which showed her he
knew his Scott intimately. But the moderns were
closed books to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the last paragraphs of his letter was a reference
that showed her his mind went straight to the relation
that lies between literature and life. His letter
concluded:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>You must not worry about me, dear. Whatever happens,
it is all right. From the night that we rode on the
raid until I said good-bye to you, I was tied hand and foot
in a web of lies. That is all past. I can’t explain it, but
somehow all the kinks have straightened out. I would
give anything to be back home, so as to look after you.
But except for that, I am at peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the prison library I got some poems by a man
called Browning. It’s queer, mixed-up stuff. I couldn’t
make head or tail of some of it, but every once in a while
he whangs out a verse that grades ’way up. Take this:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“The best is yet to be,</p>
<p class='line0'>The last of life, for which the first was made;</p>
<p class='line0'>Our times are in His hand</p>
<p class='line0'>Who said: ‘A whole I planned,</p>
<p class='line0'>Youth shows but half; trust God; see all, nor be afraid.’ ”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>Ever since I came here I had been thinking that myself,
but I didn’t know how to say it like he does. Most poets
spill a heap of language, looks like to me, but this fellow
throws a straight rope. Our times are in His Hands!
I’m banking a heap on that, honey. No need to fear—just
trust and wait. Some day our waiting will be over.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dusk had fallen before Ruth rode down the trail
to the ranch, her spirit still with Rowan up in the
pines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stovall was on the porch speeding a parting
guest, a dark-eyed, trim young woman of unobtrusive
manners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mrs. McCoy, I want you should meet an old
friend of mine—Mrs. Tait,” said the housekeeper
by way of introduction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was like a blow in the face to Ruth. She drew
herself up straight and stiff. A flush of indignation
swept into her face. With the slightest of bows she
acknowledged the presentation, then marched into
the house and to her bedroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the sweet gladness of the day was blotted out
for her. Just as she and Rowan were coming together
again the woman who had separated them
must intrude herself as a hateful reminder of the past.
She had forgiven her husband—yes; but her forgiveness
did not extend to the woman who had led him
into temptation. And even if she had pardoned him,
she had not forgotten. It would be impossible ever
quite to forget the sting of that memory with its
sense of outrage at a wrong so flagrant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not deny that she was jealous. All of
Rowan she could hold fast would not be too much
to carry her through their years of separation. Except
for this one deadening memory, she had nothing
to recall but good of him. Why must this come up
now to torment her?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A knock sounded on the door. “Supper’s ready,”
announced Mrs. Stovall tartly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t want any to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a moment’s silence Ruth heard retreating
footsteps. A few minutes later there came a second
knock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve brought you supper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The housekeeper did not wait for an invitation, but
opened the door and walked in. Never before had
she done this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth jumped to her feet from the chair where she
was sitting in the dusk. “I told you I didn’t want
any supper,” she said, annoyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stovall had promised Rowan to look after
Ruth while he was away. In her tight-lipped, sardonic
fashion she had come to be very fond of this
girl who was the victim of the frontier tragedy that
had so stirred Shoshone County. Silently she had
watched the flirtation with Larry Silcott and the
division between husband and wife. It was her firm
opinion that Ruth needed a lesson to save her from
her own foolishness. But what had occurred on
the porch a half hour since had given her a new slant
on the situation. Martha Stovall prided herself
on her plain speaking. She had a reputation for it
far and wide. She proposed to do some of it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you want any supper?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The housekeeper set the tray down on a little table
and faced her mistress. Every angular inch of her
declared that she intended to settle this matter on the
spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth was too astonished for words. Mrs. Stovall
did not miss the opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What ails you at the supper? Are you sick?”
The thin lips of the woman were pressed together
in a straight line of determination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not hungry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fiddlededee! It’s Norma Tait that’s spoiled
your appetite. What call have you to be so highty-tighty?
Isn’t she good enough for you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would rather not discuss Mrs. Tait,” answered
Ruth stiffly. “I don’t quite see why you should
come into my room and talk to me like this, Mrs.
Stovall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you? Well, maybe I’m not very polite,
but what I’ve got to say is for your good—and I’m
going to say it, even if you order me off the place
when I get through.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The answer of Ruth was rather disconcerting.
She said nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I introduced you to Norma Tait you ’most
insulted her. I’d like to know why,” demanded the
housekeeper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I won’t talk about that,” replied the
young woman with icy gentleness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I’ll do the talking. You’ve heard that
fool story about Norma and Mac. I’ll bet a cooky
that’s what is the matter with you.” The shrewd
little eyes of Martha Stovall gimleted the girl. “It’s
all a pack of lies. I ought to know, for it was me
that asked Mac to drive Norma down to Wagon
Wheel in his car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You!” The astonishment of the girl leaped from
her in the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The housekeeper nodded. “Want I should tell
you all about it?” The acidity in her voice was less
pronounced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know that Mac used to be engaged to her
and that after a quarrel Norma ran away with Tait
and married him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joe Tait was a brute. He bullied Norma and
abused her. When she couldn’t stand it any longer
she ran away and ’phoned me to get a rig to have her
taken to Wagon Wheel, so’s she could go to Laramie,
where her sister lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as though a weight were lifting from Ruth’s
heart. She waited, her big eyes fixed on those of
Mrs. Stovall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But folks didn’t want to mad Joe Tait,” went
on the housekeeper. “He was always raising a
rookus with someone. Folks knew he’d beat the
head off’n any man that helped Norma get away from
him. So they all had excuses. When I was at my
wit’s end Mac came along in his car, headed for
Wagon Wheel. I asked him to take Norma along
with him. Well, you know Mac. He said, ‘Where
is she?’ And I told him. And he took her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth nodded urgently, impatiently. She could not
hear the rest too soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mac stands up on his own hind legs. He didn’t
need to ask Joe Tait’s permission to help a woman
when she was in trouble,” explained Mrs. Stovall.
“So he took Norma down and fixed it with Moody
so’s he lent her the money for her ticket. Mac had
’phoned down to the depot agent and got the last
vacant berth to Cheyenne. He gave it up to Norma
and went into the day coach. That’s exactly what
he did. There’s been a lot of stuff told by them
that ought to ’a’ known Mac and Norma better,
and o’ course Tait spread a heap of scandal, but Bart
Mason, the Pullman conductor, told me this his
own self. Mac never even sat down beside Norma.
He talked with her a minute, and then walked right
through to the chair car.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not for an instant did Ruth doubt that this was
the true version of the story she had heard. It was
like Rowan to do just that, quietly and without any
fuss. How lacking in faith she had been ever to
doubt him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her heart sang. She caught Mrs. Stovall in her
arms and kissed the wrinkled face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been such a little fool,” she confided. “And
I’ve been so dreadfully unhappy—and it’s all been
my own fault. I got to hating Rowan, and I was
awfully mean to him. Before he went away we made
it all up, but I wasn’t any help to him at all during
the trial. I’m so glad you told me this.” She
laughed a little hysterically. “I’m the happiest
girl that ever had a lover shut up in prison for life.
And it’s all because of you. Oh, I’ve acted hatefully,
but I’ll never do it again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stovall, comforting the young wife after the
fashion of her sex, forgot that she was the cynic of the
settlement, and mingled her glad tears with those
of Ruth.</p>

<div><h1 id='ch27'>CHAPTER XXVII</h1></div>

<h3>THE SYMBOL</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>HE long white fingers of winter reached down
through the mountain gulches to the Circle
Diamond. Ruth looked out of her windows
upon a land grown chill and drear. She saw her line
riders returning to the bunk house crusted with snow
and sleet. The cattle huddled in the shelter of haystacks,
and those on the range grew rough and thin
and shaggy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The short days were too long for the mistress of
the ranch. She began to mope, and her loneliness
was accented by the bitter wind and the deep drifts
that shut her from the great world outside. A dozen
times she was on the point of going to Denver for
the winter, but her pride—and something finer than
pride, a loyalty that held her back from pleasures
Rowan could not share and tied her to interests
which knit her life to his—would not let her give up
the task she had set herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through Louise McDowell, the wife of the governor,
she ordered a package of new books sent in
from Cheyenne. With an energy almost fierce she
attacked her music again, and spent hours practising
at the piano. When the winds died down she made
Jennings show her how to travel on snowshoes, and
after that there was seldom a day during which she
could not be outdoors about the place for at least a
little while.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her fragility had always been more apparent than
real. Back of her slenderness was a good deal of
wiry strength. As the months passed she took on
flesh, and by spring was almost plump. The open
life she cultivated did not help her pink-and-white
complexion, but brought solidity to her frame and
power to her muscles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy was born in early April. Norma Tait
and Mrs. Stovall nursed her back to health, and in
a few weeks she was driving over the ranch in consultation
with Jennings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had a new venture in her mind, one of which
he did not approve at all. She intended to raise head
lettuce for the market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her foreman did his best to dissuade her from such
a radical undertaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This here is a cattle country, ma’am. Tha’s
what the Lord made it for. O’ course it’s proper
to put in some wheat an’ some alfalfa where we can
irrigate from the creek. I got nothing to say against
that, because with the price of stock good an’ the
quality improved we can’t hardly afford to have ’em
rough through the way they used to do. We got to
feed. Tha’s reasonable. But why lettuce? Why
not cabbages or persimmons or sweet peas, ma’am,
if you come to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jennings softened his derision with a friendly
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because there is money in this head lettuce. I’ve
been reading about it and corresponding with a
farmer in Colorado who raises it. He has made a
lot of money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Prob’ly he ships to Denver. But Denver ain’t
such a big city that it can’t be overstocked with a
commodity. It ain’t any New York.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he ships to New York and all over the country.
It’s like this. By midsummer the lettuce crop
of most of the country is exhausted. The weather is
too hot for it. But up in the mountains it can be
raised. It develops into a fine solid head, the crispest
in the world. Mr. Galloway, the ranchman I told
you about, writes that there is no limit to the market
and that this is going to be a permanent and a stable
crop for the Rocky Mountain country. He is very
enthusiastic about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tha’s all right too. I don’t claim he ain’t right.
But we’re cattlemen. The Circle Diamond is a
cattle ranch. It ain’t any Dago truck farm. Me,
I’d never make a vegetable-garden farmer, not onless
my farmin’ could be done from the saddle. We
know cattle; we don’ know lettuce.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there’s money in it we can learn to know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do we know there’s money in it here? This
ain’t Colorado, come to that. Maybe it takes a
particular kind of soil and temperature. Maybe
this guy Galloway just happens to be in a lucky spot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not from what I read. Anyhow, we can put
out a few acres and see how it does.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, we could,” admitted Jennings. “If
we knew how to fix the land for it an’ how to look
after it. But we don’t. Why, we don’t even know
what kind of seed to buy or what kind of ground to
put it in. Honest, ma’am, it looks plumb ridiculous
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not to me,” she dissented. “What’s the use of
saying that this is a cattle country and not good for
anything else when we haven’t tried other things?
People have to be progressive to make money. As
for your objection about us not knowing the kind of
seed to get or the sort of land to use or how to prepare
the land, why you’re wrong in all three of your
guesses. You buy seed called New York or else the
Wonderful, and you plant it in nice rich soil prepared
the way you do a garden. I thought we’d use that
twenty back of the pasture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’mp!” he grunted. “You got yore mind made
up, I see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she admitted, and added diplomatically,
“if you approve.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whether I approve or not,” he grinned. “A lot
you care about me approvin’. You’re some bull-haided
when you get started, if you ask me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you can show me that I am wrong, of
course——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He threw up his hands. “I can’t. I wouldn’t
ever try to show a lady she was wrong. All I can do
is get ready to say, ‘I done told you so’ when you
waken from yore dream about makin’ two haids of
lettuce grow where there ain’t any growin’ now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think I won’t make it grow, and I’ll lose
money?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, yes, ma’am. I hate to say so, but that’s
sure how it looks to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave him her vivid smile. “You’re going to
live to take off your hat and apologize humbly, Mr.
Jennings,” she prophesied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I sure hope so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth made her preparations to go ahead and
assumed that the foreman was as enthusiastic as
she was. She did not have to assume that he was
loyal and would support her project with a whole
heart when it once got under way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though she had a healthy interest in making the
most of the ranch, Ruth’s real absorption was in the
baby. He was a continuous joy and delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan, junior, was king of the Circle Diamond
from his birth. He ruled imperiously over the
hearts of the three women. It was natural that Ruth
should love him from the moment that they put him
in her arms and his little heel kicked her in the side.
He was the symbol of the love of Rowan that glowed
so steadfastly in her soul. So she worshipped him
for his own sake and for the sake of the man she had
married. The small body that breathed so close to
her, so helpless and so soft, filled her with everlasting
wonder and delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His daily bath was a function. Ruth presided
over it herself, but Norma, and often Mrs. Stovall,
too, made excuses to be present. His plump legs
wrinkled into such kissable creases as he lay on his
back and waved them in the air, his smiling little
mouth was such an adorable Cupid’s bow that the
young mother vowed in her heart there never had
been such a boy since time began.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she did not coddle him. His mother had
read the latest books on the care of babies, and she
intended to bring him up scientifically. He spent
a large part of his time sleeping on a screened porch,
and, as he grew older, Ruth took him with her when
she drove over the place on business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In every letter she wrote Rowan the baby held
first place, but she was careful to show him that the
boy was <span class='it'>his</span> son as well as hers, a bond between
them from the past and a promise for the future.
In one letter she wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>I took Boy up into the pine copse back of the house this
afternoon. We were there, you and I and he, and we had
such a lovely time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Isn’t it strange, dear, that the things we care about
become so infinitely a part of all life that touches us?
There is no beautiful thing of sound or vision or colour—no
poignancy of thought or feeling—that does not become
a sign, somehow, for the special gladness—as though, at
bottom, all beauty and dearness rested on the same foundation.
To-day the wind has blown swift and gray and
strong, so that the hills are purple with it, and the marching
pines are touched to a low, tremendous murmur. It
is magnificent, as though something too vast and solemn
for sight passed by and one could hear only the sweeping
of its wings. And the thrill of it is one and the same with
the gladness of your letter of yesterday. There is in the
heart of them both something finer and bigger than I once
could have conceived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While I was putting Rowan, junior, to bed I showed him
your picture—the one the Denver <span class='it'>Times</span> photographer
took just after you won the championship last year—and
he reached out his dimpled fingers for it and spluttered,
“Da-da-da-da-da.” I believe he knows you belong
to him. Before I put his nightie on I kissed his dear little
pink body for you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you know that we are about to entertain distinguished
visitors at the Circle Diamond? Louise McDowell
and the governor are going to stay with us a day on their
way to Yellowstone Park. I can’t help feeling that it is a
good omen. Last year when I went to Cheyenne he
would not give me any hope—said he could not possibly
do anything for me. But there has been a great change
of sentiment here. Tim Flanders talked with the governor
not long since, and urged a parole for you. I feel sure the
governor would not visit me unless he was at least in doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So I’m eager to try again, with Rowan, junior, to plead
for me. He’s going to make love to the governor, innocently
and shamelessly, in a hundred darling little ways
he has. Oh, you don’t know how hard I’m going to try
to win the governor this time, dear.</p>

<h3>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>G</span>OVERNOR McDOWELL was a cattleman
himself. His sympathies were much engaged
in behalf of the Bald Knob raiders. All the
evidence at the trial tended to show that Tait had
forced the trouble and had refused all compromise.
From his talk with the prisoners the governor had
learned that the tragedy had flared out unexpectedly.
Personally he liked Rowan McCoy very much. But
he could not get away from the fact that murder had
been done. As a private citizen, McDowell would
have worked hard to get his friend a parole; as
governor of the State of Wyoming he could not move
in the matter without a legitimate excuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was his hope of finding such an excuse that led
him to diverge from the direct road to Yellowstone
for a stop at the Circle Diamond Ranch. On the
way he called at the ranches of several old-timers
whom he had long known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s like this, Phil,” one of them told the governor.
“The Government has stepped in and settled this
whole sheep and cattle war. We don’t aim to go
night raiding any more—none of us. Sheep are here,
and they’re going to stay whether we like it or not.
So we got to make the best of it—and we do. What’s
the use of keeping Mac and Brad and the other boys
locked up for an example when we don’t need one
any more? Everybody would be satisfied to see ’em
paroled; even the sheepmen would. You couldn’t
do a more popular thing than to free the whole passell
of ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The governor made no promises, but he kept his
ears open to learn the drift of public opinion. Even
before he reached Circle Diamond he knew that there
would be no strong protest against a parole from the
western part of the State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth did not make the mistake of letting the
governor see her in the rough-and-ready ranch
costume to which she was accustomed. She dressed
her hair with care and wore a simple gown that set
off the slender fullness of her figure. When she came
lightly and swiftly to meet them as the car drew up
at the Circle Diamond, her guests were impressed
anew with the note of fineness, of personal distinction.
There was, too, something gallant and spirited in
the poise of the small head set so fastidiously upon
the rounded throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. McDowell always admired tremendously her
school companion. She was more proud of her than
ever now, and as she dressed for dinner she attacked
her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got to do something for her, Phil. That’s
all there’s to it. I can’t look that brave girl in the
face if you don’t let her husband out of prison.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was wrestling with a collar and a reluctant
button. “H’mp!” he grunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that baby—did you ever see such a darling?
It’s a crime to keep his father away from him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a crime to keep a lot of men in prison, but we
do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not worrying about the rest of them. But
Ruth’s husband—you’ve just got to let him out.”
She came in and perched herself down on a couch
beside him and cuddled him in a cajoling fashion
she had.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t bribe me, young lady,” he blustered.
“Don’t you see that I can’t let McCoy out unless I
parole his accomplices, too? This isn’t a matter to
be decided by personal friendship. I’ve got to do
what’s right—what seems right to the average sense
of the community.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think it’s right to keep Ruth’s husband
shut up from her and the baby?” she demanded
indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I wish I did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You told me yourself that he’s a fine man,”
Louise reminded him triumphantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I talk too much,” he groaned humorously. “But
say he is. The penitentiaries are full of fine men.
I can’t free them all. He and his friends killed two
men. That’s the point. I can’t turn them all loose
in a year. Folks would say it was because I’m a
cattleman and that Rowan and Brad Rogers are my
friends. What’s more, they would have a right to
say it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth and Tim Flanders showed the guests over
the ranch, and afterward in the absence of the mistress,
who was in the kitchen consulting with Mrs.
Stovall about the dinner, the owner of the Dude
Ranch sang her praises with enthusiasm:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never saw her beat, Phil. That slim little girl
you could break in two over your knee has got more
git-up-and-dust than any man I know. Mac wanted
her to sell the ranch and live off the proceeds. Did
she do it? Not so you could notice it. She grabbed
hold with both hands, cleared off the debts of the
trial, wiped off the mortgage, got a permit to run a
big bunch of cattle on the reserve, and has made
money hand over fist. Now she’s in lettuce an’
I’m blamed if I don’t think she’s liable to make some
money out of it. Two or three others are aimin’ to
put some out next year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>McDowell smiled dryly. “She’s doing so well
it would be a pity to let Mac come home and gum the
works up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But in his heart the governor was full of admiration
for this vital young woman who had thrown herself
with such pluck and intelligence into the task of
saving the ranch for her imprisoned husband. The
situation troubled him. He wanted to do for her
the most that he legitimately could, but he came
up always against the same barrier. Rowan McCoy
had been convicted of first-degree murder. He had
no right to pardon him within fifteen months without
any new, extenuating evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The governor was a warm-souled Scotch Irishman.
Until the past year he had been a bachelor. He was
very fond of children. Rowan, junior, walked right
into his heart. Children have an infallible instinct
that tells them when they are liked. The young
boss of the Circle Diamond opened up his mouth
in a toothless grin and stretched his dimpled fingers
to the governor. He rubbed noses with him, goo-gooed
at him, clung mightily with his little doubled
fist to his excellency’s forefinger. Whenever Rowan
was in the room he claimed the big man immediately
and definitely. As for the governor, he surrendered
without capitulation. He was a willing slave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None the less, he was glad when the time came
for him to go. It made the big, simple cattleman
uncomfortable not to be able to relieve the sorrow
of this girl whom his wife loved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth made her chance to see him alone and let
him know at once what was in her heart. She stood
before him white and tremulous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about Rowan, Governor?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head. “I wish I could do what you
want. In a couple of years I can, but not yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She bit her lip. The big tears came into her eyes
and splashed over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now don’t you—don’t you,” he pleaded, stroking
her hand in his big ones. “I’d do it if I could—if I
were free to follow my own wishes. But I’m not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Softly she wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Get me some new evidence—something to prove
that Mac didn’t shoot Gilroy himself—and I’ll see
what I can do. You see how it is, Ruth. Someone
shot him while he was unarmed. All five of them
pleaded guilty. If Mac’s lawyers can find the man
that did the killing I’ll parole the others. That’s the
best I can do for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With that promise Ruth had to be content.</p>

<h3>A DISAPPOINTMENT</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>D</span>URING the second winter Ruth left the
ranch only twice, except for runs down to
Wagon Wheel. Late in January she went
to Cheyenne with her boy to make another appeal
to the governor. He was full of genuine homely
kindness to her, and renewed at once his allegiance
to Rowan, junior. With the large hospitality of the
West, he urged her to spend the next few months as
their guest, to postpone her return at least until the
snow was out of the hills. But in the matter of a
parole he stood firm against the entreaties of his wife,
the touching wistfulness of her friend, and the tug
of desire at his own big heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her other visit was in April to the penitentiary.
McCoy was away as a trusty in charge of a road-building
gang near Casper. But it was not her
husband that Ruth had come to see. She wanted
to make a plea to the one man who could help her.
She carried an order from Governor McDowell
permitting her to see him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hour she had chosen was inauspicious.
Falkner, sullen and dogged, was brought in irons to
the office of the warden. His face was badly swollen
and cut. He pretended not to recognize Ruth, but
stood, heavy and lowering, his sunken eyes set defiantly
straight before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s been in solitary for a week,” explained the
warden. “Makes us more trouble than any two
men here. This time he hit a guard over the head
with a shovel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prisoner had the baited look of a hunted wild
animal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m so sorry,” breathed Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was plain to her at a glance that he was much
more of a wild beast than he had been when she last
saw him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You needn’t be sorry for him. He brings it all
on himself.” The warden turned curtly to Falkner.
“This lady wants to talk to you. See you behave
yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when she was alone with this battered hulk
her carefully prepared arguments all fell away from
her. She felt instinctively that they would have
no weight with him. She hesitated, uncertain how
to proceed. The best she could do was to repeat
herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sorry they don’t treat you well, Mr. Falkner.
Is there anything I can do for you—tobacco or anything
like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave her a sulky sidewise look, but did not
answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re all hoping you’ll get out soon,” she went
on bravely. “They are talking of getting up a petition
for all of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She stuck again. His whole attitude was unfriendly
and hostile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I’ve come to ask another favour of you.
Perhaps you don’t know that I have a little baby
now. I’m trying to get Rowan out on parole, but the
governor won’t do anything unless we bring evidence
to show that he did not kill Mr. Gilroy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He clung still to his obstinate silence. His eyes
were watching her now steadily. It came to her
that her suffering pleased him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I’ve come to you, Mr. Falkner. You are
the only man that can help me. If you’ll make a
statement that you shot Mr. Gilroy the governor will
give me back my husband. I’m asking it for the
sake of my little baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pulse beat fast in her throat. A tremor passed
through her body. The eyes begged him to be merciful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed, and the sound of his laughter was
harsh and cruel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d see the whole outfit of you rot first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m sure you don’t mean that,” she said gently.
“You haven’t been treated well here, and naturally
you feel hard about it. Anybody would. But I’m
sure you want to be fair to your friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My friends!” he jeered bitterly. “Tha’s a good
one. My friends!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t Rowan your friend? You told me yourself
that he had stood by you to the finish, though it
almost cost him his own life. If he had lifted a
finger and pointed it at you he and the others would
have been given short terms and you would have been
hanged. You said as much to me that day down at
Wagon Wheel. Won’t you say as much to the
governor now? It can’t hurt you, and it would bring
happiness to so many people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You want me to be the goat, eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you to tell the truth. Rowan would in
your place. He’d never let women and children
suffer for his wrongdoing. I don’t think you would
if you thought of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re wastin’ yore breath,” he told her sulkily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you could see Missie Yerby and her little
boy. They get along somehow because the neighbours
help with the cattle. She doesn’t complain.
She’s brave. But she does miss Sam dreadfully. So
does the little boy. He’s a nice manly little chap, but
he needs a father. It isn’t right that he shouldn’t have
one. He often asks when his dad is coming home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ain’t keepin’ him here,” he growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Mrs. Rogers will be an old woman soon
if Brad doesn’t get out. I can see her fading away.
It seems to me that if I could help them by saying
a few words, by just telling the truth, that it would
give me pleasure to make them happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Different here,” he snarled. “It’s every one for
himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t what you told me that day at Wagon
Wheel,” she said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. I’ve changed my mind. Let it go at
that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kate is still waiting for Jack Cole. She won’t
look at any other man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Makes no difference to me if she waits till Kingdom
Come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s three women who are unhappy, and
Jack’s mother is another, and I’m the fifth. Five
women and two children you could make glad by
confessing that you started the shooting and killed
Mr. Gilroy. Not many men have an opportunity
like that. We would bless you in our prayers,
Mr. Falkner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep right on soft-soapin’ me. See where it
gets you,” he taunted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ignored his retort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d do more for you than that. We’d all
work for your pardon, too. We’d show how Joe
Tait had beaten you up when you hadn’t a chance
and how quarrelsome he was. Pretty soon we’d
get you out, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The hell you would! Don’t I know? I’d stand
the gaff for all of ’em. Ain’t I doing it now? Rowan’s
out somewheres bossin’ a road gang. Rogers is in
the warden’s office. Sam Yerby putters around the
garden. An’ me—I live in that damned dark hole
alone. They’re warden’s little pets. I’m the one
that gets the whip. By God, if I ever get a chance at
one of these slave-drivers——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He broke off, to grind his teeth in a fury of impotent
rage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t! Don’t feel that way,” she begged.
“You get all the worst of it. Don’t you see you do?
And it makes you unhappy. Let me tell the warden
that you’ll try not to break the prison rules. It
would be so much better for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell him I’ll cut his black heart out if I ever get a
chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was appalled at his venomous hatred. Vaguely
she knew that prison discipline was often harsh.
Occasionally some echo of it crept into newspapers.
Falkner was refractory and undisciplined. No
doubt he had broken rules and been insubordinate.
It came to her that there had been some contest of
stubborn will between this lawless convict and the
guards who had charge of him. His face was scarred
with wounds not yet healed. She did not know that
ridges crossed and recrossed his back where the lash
had cut away the skin with cruel strokes which had
burned like fire. But she did know that he was
untamed and unbroken, that nothing short of death
could make that wild spirit quail before his tormentors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I could help you,” she said. “But I
can’t. All I can do is ask you to help me. Won’t
you think about it, please? I know you’re a man.
You’re not afraid to take the blame that belongs to
you. If you could only see this straight, the way
you would see it if you were outdoors in the hills,
I know you would help me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t need to think about it. I’m playin’ my
own hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The governor says that if I can get any evidence,
any proof that Rowan did not start the shooting or
kill Gilroy, he will give him a pardon. It lies with
you, Mr. Falkner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ve done given you my answer. I’m for
myself, an’ for nobody else. Tha’s the bed rock of
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Rowan’s freedom Ruth would have gone a
long way. She had humbled herself to plead with
the convict. But she had known it would be useless.
His environment had so deadened his moral sense,
so numbed his sympathy, that she could strike no
response from him. When she left the prison it was
with the knowledge that she had not advanced her
husband’s cause one whit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In front of the warden’s house a convict was wheeling
manure and scattering it on the lawn. Some
trick of gesture caught the attention of Ruth. Her
arrested eyes fixed themselves on the man. His
shoulders drooped, and his whole attitude expressed
dejected listlessness, but she was sure she knew
him. Deserting the warden’s wife, she ran forward
with both hands outstretched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I’m so glad to see you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant a puzzled expression lifted the white
eyebrows and slackened the lank jaw of Sam Yerby.
Then his shoulders straightened. He had been
caught with his guard down, detected in the mood of
hopelessness into which he often fell now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came gamely to time. “Well—well, Miss
Ruth. I’m sure proud to see you, ma’am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They told me you were at a road camp. One
of the guards said so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was, but I’m back. You’re looking fine,
ma’am. Missie writes me you-all done got a little
baby of yore own now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded. “Yes, I’ll tell you all about it.
But how are you? Missie will ask me a hundred
questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m tol’able, thank you.” Yerby, looking across
her shoulder, saw a guard moving toward them. He
did not mention to her that he was liable to ten
days’ solitary confinement for talking to a visitor
without permission. “How’s Missie—and Son?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Missie is prettier than ever. She’s always
talking about you. And the boy—he’s the dandiest
little chap—smart as a whip and good as gold.
You’ll be awfully pleased with him when you come
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes’m—when I come home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His voice fell flat. Its lifelessness went to the
heart of his friend. She saw that hope was dead
within him. He was getting into the fifties, and the
years were slipping away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That won’t be long. We’re getting up a petition
to——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guard pushed between Ruth and the convict.
“You know the rule, Yerby,” he said curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir, and I most generally aim to keep it.
But when a lady speaks to me—an old friend——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come along with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old cowman dropped his shovel and shambled
off beside the guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth turned in consternation to the wife of the
warden. “What have I done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He oughtn’t to have talked with you. That’s
the rule. He knew it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You won’t let him be punished because I made
a mistake, will you? He’s a Texan, you know. He
thinks it wouldn’t be courteous not to answer a
lady. It would make me very unhappy if I had got
him into trouble.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The warden’s wife smiled. “I think it can be
arranged this time. We all like him. We’re all
sorry for him. He takes it to heart a good deal that
he has to stay in prison. I talk with him when he
pots my plants, and he tells me he wants to hear the
whining of a rope and to taste the dust of the drag
driver, whatever that is. I wish the governor would
pardon him. If he stays much longer he’ll become an
old man with no hope in his heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll tell his wife that you are good to him. It
will be a great comfort to her. She’s a good deal
younger than he is, but she’s very fond of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meeting with Yerby depressed Ruth more
even than her encounter with Falkner. She took
home with her a memory of a brave man slowly
having the zest of life pressed out of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But of this she said little when next she wrote to
Rowan. Always her letters had running through
them the red thread of hope. She told him that
Flanders was getting up a petition for a parole which
had been signed by half the county, including the
judge who had tried him, every member of the jury,
the prosecuting attorney, and the sheriff. Nor did
she mention that Ruth McCoy was the motive power
behind the petition, that she in person had won
the signatures of Haight, Matson, and the judge,
as well as hundreds of others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clock struck midnight before she finished her
letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>It is very late, sweetheart—almost utterly quiet, save
for a small wind among the leaves, and the night is black
and soft, and abloom with stars. Stillness and stars and
whispering wind—they are all astir with dreams and questions—yes,
and answers, too. I feel sure of that, love—as
sure as I do of you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you take “good-night” born of the night’s voices,
dear?</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>She signed her name, turned out the lights, and
sat long at the low window, her fingers laced around
her knee. The thoughts back of her hungry, shadowy
eyes were gropings for the answers of which
she had written so confidently.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='ch30'>CHAPTER XXX</h1></div>

<h3>THE BLIZZARD</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>GAIN spring bloomed into summer and summer
yellowed into autumn. A mellow,
golden glow lay over the valleys, and in the
foothills purple asters and pink thistles lent patches
of colour to a brown land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the daytime Ruth was busy with business
details of the round-up, of the fall beef shipment, of
planting and of harvesting. The lettuce crop had
been very successful and Jennings had long ago
made the <span class='it'>amende honorable</span> for his doubts. She
had experimented with pinto beans, and these were
no sooner cut and stacked than the men were hard
at it putting in winter wheat. As soon as dusk fell
she devoted herself to the baby until he went to
sleep for the night. In the evening she took up the
accounts of the ranch, wrote to Rowan, held a conference
with Jennings, or did a little desultory
reading. The housekeeping she left almost entirely
in the competent hands of Mrs. Stovall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition to the business of the Circle Diamond
and superintending the care of a year-old baby,
Ruth had other claims upon her time that she could
not ignore. One of these was her promise to Sam
Yerby to look after Missie and the boy. It was her
custom to have them down for a day every other
month and to visit the Yerby place between times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On a day in mid-November, with Rowan, junior,
beside her, Ruth set out in the car for the little mountain
ranch. It was a cool crisp morning. The sting
of frost was in the air, and the indigo mountains were
ribbed with white in the snow-filled gulches. To
the nostrils came the tang of sage and later of pine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After she had driven from the foothills into the
cañon, Ruth stopped to wrap an extra blanket around
the baby, for the sun was painting only the upper
walls as yet, and down by the creek there was an
inch-thick ice at the edges. The early fall snows
were melting on the sunny slopes above, and Hill
Creek was pouring down in a flood. The road
crossed the creek twice, but after she was on it Ruth
discovered that the second bridge was very shaky.
The car got over safely, but she decided to take the
high-line road home, even though it was a few miles
longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Robert E. Lee Yerby came running down to the
gate to meet them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Auntie Rufe!” he shouted. “Mumma’s
peelin’ a chicken for dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth caught the youngster up and hugged him.
He was an attractive little chap, with the bluest of
eyes and the most ingenuous of smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I like you, Auntie Rufe. You always smell like
pink woses,” he confided with the frankness of extreme
youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His r’s were all w’s, but the young woman understood
him. She gave him another hug in payment
for the compliment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve brought budda to play with you, Bobbie.”
“Budda” was the nearest Robert could come to the
word brother at the time Rowan was born, and the
word had stuck with him, as is the way with children.
“Now let me go. I must get out and shut the gate.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it don’t hurt if it’s open. Mumma said so,
tos everyfing’s in the pasture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she went into the house with Missie, stripping
the driving gauntlets from her hands, Ruth noticed
that clouds were banking in the sky over the summit
of the range. It looked like snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The days she spent with Ruth were red-letter
ones for Mrs. Yerby. Missie was a simple mountain
girl, born and bred in the Wyoming hills. What little
schooling she had had was of the country-district
kind. It did not go far, and was rather sketchy even
to the point she had gone. But this radiant, vital
girl from the cities, so fine and beautiful, and yet so
generous of her friendship, so competent and strong
and self-reliant, but so essentially feminine—Missie
accepted what she offered with a devotion that came
near worship. She did not understand how anybody
could help loving Ruth McCoy. To be elected one
of her friends was a rare privilege. Perhaps this
unquestioning approval of all she was and did, together
with Mrs. Yerby’s need of her, did more to
win Ruth than any effort the other woman could have
made. She was plentifully endowed with human
failings, and flattery of this sort was no doubt incense
to her self-esteem.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women chatted and worked while the youngsters
played on the floor. Just before dinner a cow-puncher
from the Triangle Dot rode up and trailed
into the house with spurs a-jingle. He had come to
tell Mrs. Yerby about one of her yearlings he had
rescued from a swamp and was keeping in the corral
for a day or two. His nostrils sniffed the dinner in
the kitchen, and it was not hard to persuade him to
stay and eat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wha’ a’ is?” demanded Robert E. Lee Yerby,
pointing to the rowel on the high heel of the rider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a spur, son, for to jog a bronc’s memory when
it gits to dreamin’,” explained the young man. “I
reckon I’ll step out and wash up for dinner, Mrs.
Yerby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When he came in, his red face glowing from soap
and water, it was with a piece of news he had till that
moment forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ladies heard about Hal Falkner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth, putting a platter of fried chicken on the
table, turned abruptly to him. “What about him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He escaped from the pen four days ago—beat
up a guard ’most to death and made his get-away.
Four prisoners were in the jailbreak, but they’ve got
’em all but Hal. He reached the hills somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eyes of Ruth McCoy asked a question she
dared not put into words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, ma’am. None of the rest of our boys mixed
up in it a-tall,” he told her quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman drew a deep breath of relief.
The hope was always with her of a day near at hand
when the Bald Knob raiders would be paroled, but
she knew if they joined such an undertaking as this
it would be fatal to their chances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think Mr. Falkner will get away?” Ruth
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon not, ma’am. You see, he’s got the
telephone against him. Whenever he shows up at a
ranch the news will go out that he was there. But he
got holt of a gun from a farmer. It’s a cinch they
won’t take him without a fight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Snow was already falling when the cow-puncher
took his departure. He cast a weather eye toward
the hills. “Heap much snow in them clouds. If
I was you, Mrs. McCoy, I’d start my gasoline bronc
on the home trail so’s not to run any chances of getting
stalled.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth thought this good advice. It took a few
minutes to wrap Rowan for the journey and to say
good-bye. By the time she was on the way the
air was full of large flakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The storm increased steadily as she drove toward
home. There was a rising wind that brought the
sleet about her in sharp gusts. So fierce became
the swirl that when she turned into the high-line drive
she was surrounded by a white, stinging wall that
narrowed the scope of her vision to a few feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The temperature was falling rapidly, and the wind
swept the hilltops with a roar. The soft flakes had
turned to powdered ice. It beat upon Ruth with
a deadly chill that searched to the bones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young mother became alarmed. The boy
was well wrapped up, but no clothing was sufficient
protection against a blizzard. Moreover, there
were dangerous places to pass, cuts where the path
ran along the sloping edge of the mountain with a
sheer fall of a hundred feet below. It would never
do to try to take these with snow heavy on the ledge
and the way blurred so that she could not see clearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth stopped and tried to adjust the curtains.
But her fingers were like ice, and the knobs so sleet-incrusted
that she could not fasten the buttons. It
was her intention to drive back to the Yerby ranch,
and she backed the car into a drift while trying to
turn. The snow was so slippery that the wheel
failed to get a grip. She tried again and again
without success, and at last killed the engine. Her
attempts to crank it were complete failures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a moment for swift decision. Ruth made
hers instantly. She took the baby from the front
seat, wrapped him close to her in all the blankets she
had, and started forward toward a deserted miner’s
cabin built in a draw close to the trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half a mile is no distance when the sun is shining
and the path is clear. But near and far take on
different meanings in a blizzard. Drifts underfoot
made the going slow. The pelting wind, heavy with
the sting of sleet, beat upon her, sifted through her
clothes, and sapped her vitality. More than once
her numbed legs doubled under her like the blades
of a jackknife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth knew she was in deadly peril. She recalled
stories of how men had wandered for hours in the
white whirl, and had lain down to die at last within
a stone’s throw of their own houses. A young
schoolteacher from Denver had perished three years
before with one of her hands clutching the barbwire
strand that led to safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the will to live was strong in the young mother.
For the sake of that precious young life in her arms
she dared not give up. Indomitably she fought
against the ice-laden wind which flung sleet waves
at her to paralyse her energy, benumb her muscles,
and chill the blood in her arteries. More than once
she went down, her frozen legs buckling under her
as she moved. But always she struggled to her feet
again and plowed forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last she staggered down an incline to a dip in
the road. This might or might not be the draw that
led to the cabin. There was no way of telling.
But she had to make a choice, and life for both her
and the baby hung upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her instinct told her she could go no farther.
Ruth left the road, plunged into the drifts, and fought
her way up the gulch. It was her last effort, and
she knew it. When she went down it was all she
could do to drag herself to her feet again. But
somehow she crawled forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of the whirling snow loomed a log wall within
reach of her hand. She staggered along it to the
door, felt for the latch, found it, and stumbled into
the hut.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='ch31'>CHAPTER XXXI</h1></div>

<h3>“COMPANY FOR EACH OTHER”</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>R</span>UTH, weak and shaken from her struggle
with the storm, stood in bewildered amazement
near the door. A man was facing her,
in his hands a rifle. He stood crouched and wary,
like a wolf at bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man was Falkner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any more of you?” he demanded. Not for an
instant had his eyes relaxed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure of that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded, too much exhausted for speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine!” he went on, lowering his gun slowly.
“We’ll be company for each other. Better shut the
door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instead, she staggered forward to the table and
put down the bundle of shawls. Her arms were as
heavy as though they were weighted. She sank
down on the long bench in front of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like many deserted mining cabins, this one still
held the home-made furniture the prospector had
built with a hammer and a saw. In one corner was
a rusty old stove, just now red-hot from a crackling
wood fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Storm-bound, I reckon,” suggested the man,
watching her with narrowed lids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she panted. “Going home from Yerbys’.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From outside came the shriek of the rising
storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good, my
dear,” he grinned, with a flash of his broken teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth looked round at him, her steady eyes fixed
in his. There came to her a fugitive memory of
meeting him on a hill trail with that look in his eyes
that was a sacrilege to her womanhood. She remembered
once before when he had used those words,
“my dear.” Since then the wolf in him had become
full grown, fed by the horrors of his prison life. He
was a hunted creature. His hand was against society
and its against him. The bars that had restrained
him in the old days were down. He was a throwback
to the cave man, and, what was worse, that primitive
animal with enemies hot on his trail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this adventure had befallen her two years earlier
the terror-stricken eyes of the girl would have betrayed
her, the blood in her veins would have chilled
with horror. But she had learned to be captain of
her soul. Whatever fear she may have felt, none
of it reached the surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A little wail rose from the bundle of shawls.
Falkner, his nerves jumpy from sleepless nights and
the continuous strain of keeping his senses alert,
flashed a quick, suspicious look around the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth turned and unloosened the wraps. The
convict, taken by sheer astonishment, moved forward
a step or two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’ll be dog-goned! You got a kid in there,”
he said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At sight of his mother the face of the youngster
cleared. Through all the fight with the storm, snug
and warm in his nest, he had slept peacefully. But
now he had wakened, and objected to being half
smothered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you remember?” Ruth asked the man.
“I told you I had a baby. Do you think he is like
me or Rowan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She walked straight to him, and held the baby up
for his inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner murmured something that sounded like
an oath. But it happened that Rowan, junior, took
to men. He smiled and stretched out his arms.
Before the outlaw could speak, before he could voice
the sullen rejection of friendliness that was in his
mind, Ruth had pushed the boy into his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The soft little hands of the baby explored the rough
face of the man. Rowan, junior, beamed with delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You da-da,” he announced confidently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth managed a little laugh. “He’s claiming
you already, Mr. Falkner, even though he doesn’t
know that meeting you has probably saved our lives.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For years Falkner had fought his snarling way
against those who held the upper hand. Hatred and
bitterness had filled his soul. But the contact with
this soft, helpless bit of gurgling humanity sent a
queer thrill through him. It was as if pink velvet
of exquisite texture, breathing delicious life, were
rubbing itself against his cheek. But it was not
alone the physical sensation that reached him.
Somehow the little beggar, so absolutely sure of his
welcome, twined those dimpled fingers around the
heartstrings of the callous man. Not since his
mother’s death had any human being come to him
with such implicit trust. The Adam’s apple in the
convict’s throat shot up and registered emotion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The blamed little cuss! See him grab a-holt of
my ear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth left the baby in his arms, took off her coat,
and walked to the stove. She held out her hands
and began to warm them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We were in the car,” she explained. “I took
the high-line back because I was afraid of the upper
bridge. The machine stalled in a drift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t ask me how-come I’m here,” he
growled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know,” she said simply. “Art Philips dropped
in to Yerbys’ and stayed for dinner. He told us you
escaped four days ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he tell you I killed a guard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He said you wounded one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“First I knew he wasn’t dead. Wish I’d been
more thorough. If ever a man needed killing, he
did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They abused you a good deal, didn’t they?” she
ventured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ripped out a sudden furious oath. “If ever
I get a chance at two or three of them——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Better not think of that now. The question is
how you are going to get away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that to you?” he demanded, his suspicions
all alert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought if you’d come down to the Circle
Diamond you could get a horse. That would give
you a much better chance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how do I know you wouldn’t ’phone to
Matson?” he sneered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him. “Don’t you know me better
than that, Mr. Falkner?” she said gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He mumbled what might be taken either for an
apology or for an oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s all right. I dare say I wouldn’t be very
trustful myself if I had been through what you have.”
Ruth tossed him a smiling nod and dismissed the
subject. “But we’re not down at the ranch yet.
How long is this storm likely to last, Mr. Falkner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It will blow itself out before morning. Too
early in the season for it to last. I reckon it’s only
a one-day blizzard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t think there will be any trouble about
getting down to-morrow, do you?” she asked anxiously.
“I’m not worried about myself, but I’ve got
to get food for Baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Depends on the snow,” he said sulkily. “If
it keeps on, you can’t break trail and carry the kid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you could go with me; then you could
cut out a horse and ride away after dark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t have to go down there. I can pick up a
horse at Yerbys’.” He added grudgingly in explanation:
“Me for the hills. I don’t want to get down
into the valleys, where too many people are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At midnight the storm outside was still howling
and the sleety snow was beating against the window.
The wind, coming straight from the divide above,
buffeted the snow clouds in front of it. Drifts
sifted and shifted as the snow whirled with the changing
gusts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young mother, crouched behind the stove with
her baby asleep across her knees, drowsed at times
and wakened again with a start to see half-shuttered
eyes shining across at her from the other side of the
fire. In the darkness of the night she was afraid.
Those gleaming points of light, always focused on
her, were too suggestive of a beast of prey. With
that blizzard raging outside she was a thousand
miles from help, beyond the chance of human aid in
case of need.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again her instinct served Ruth well. She rose
stiffly and carried the baby across to the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you mind holding him for a while? I’ve
been still so long my muscles are stiff and numb.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Grudgingly Falkner took the baby, but as the
warm body of the sleeping child nestled close to him
he felt once more that queer tug at his heart. A
couple of inches of the fat, pink little legs were exposed
where the dress had fallen back. The man’s
rough forefinger touched the soft flesh gently. To
the appeal of this amazing miracle—a helpless babe
asleep in his arms—everything that was good and
fine in him responded. He had lived a harsh and
bitter life, he had cherished hatred and dwelt with
his own evil imagination; but as he looked down and
felt the clutch of those small fingers on his wrist the
devil that had been in his eyes slowly vanished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth tramped the floor till the pin pricks and the
numbness were gone from her limbs. Then she returned
to her place against the wall back of the stove.
Her eyes closed drowsily, opened again. She told
herself that she must not fall asleep—dare not.
Falkner was sitting motionless with Rowan in his
arms, his whole attention on the child. The woman’s
head nodded. She struggled to shake off the sleep
that was stealing over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she wakened it was broad day. A slant of
sunshine made a ribbon of gold across the floor.
Rowan was crying a little fretfully, and the convict
was dancing him up and down as a diversion from his
hunger.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='ch32'>CHAPTER XXXII</h1></div>

<h3>THE CLOUDS BREAK</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>“C</span>AN’T you do something for this kid?” the
man asked gruffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth took the baby. “He’s hungry,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we’d better be hitting the trail.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner walked to the door and flung it open.
He looked out upon a world of white-blanketed hills.
The sun was throwing from them a million sparkles
of light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gimme that kid,” the outlaw said roughly.
“We gotta get him down to breakfast. Here!
You take my gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth wrapped up the baby warmly and handed
him to Falkner. The man broke trail to the point
where the draw struck the road. He looked to the
right, then to the left. Safety lay for him in the
mountains; for her and Rowan, junior, at the Circle
Diamond, which was three miles nearer than Yerby’s
ranch. The way up the cañon would be harder to
travel than the way down. There was a chance
that they could not make it through the snow, even a
probability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which way?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to the left toward the Circle Diamond.
The heart of the girl leaped. The convict had put
the good of the child before his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day had turned warm, so that before they had
travelled half an hour the snow was beginning to get
soft and slushy. The going was heavy. Ruth was
not wearing her heavy, high-laced boots, but the
shoes she was accustomed to use indoors. Soon
her stockings were wringing wet and the bottoms
of her skirts were soaked. It was mostly a downhill
grade, but within the hour she was fagged. It cost
an effort to drag her foot up for each step. She did
not want to be a quitter, but at last she had to speak:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t go any farther. Leave me here and send
the boys to get me. Mrs. Stovall will look after the
baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The outlaw stopped. There was grudging admiration
in the glance he gave her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can make it. We’re through the worst part.
Soon we’ll be in the foothills, and there the snow is
real light.” After a moment he added: “We ain’t
runnin’ for a train. Take your time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He brushed the snow from a rock and told her with
a wave of his hand to sit down. After a few minutes’
rest she rose and told him she was ready to try
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner’s prediction of a lighter snowfall down in
the foothills proved correct. They rounded a rocky
point, which brought them within sight of the Circle
Diamond. The smoke from the house rose straight
up in the brilliant sunshine. It looked very near and
close, but the deceptive air of the Rockies could no
longer fool Ruth. They still had two miles to go.
The descent to the valley was very rapid from here, and
she could see that a scant two inches would measure
the depth of the snow into which they were moving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young woman sloshed along behind. She
was very tired, and her shoulders sagged from exhaustion.
But she set her teeth in a game resolve to
buck up and get through somehow. One after another
she tried the old devices for marking progress.
She would pick a mark fifty yards ahead and vow
to reach it, and then would select another goal, and
after it was passed choose a third. One—two—three—four—five,
she counted her steps to a hundred,
began again and checked off a second century, and
so kept on until she had added lap after lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came to the Circle Diamond line fence,
crawled between the strands, and tramped across the
back pasture toward the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth must by this time have been half asleep.
Her feet moved almost of their own volition, as if by
clockwork. She went forward like an automaton
wound up by a set will that had become comatose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A startled shout brought her back to life abruptly.
A man with a raised rifle was standing near the bunk
house. He was covering Falkner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swift as a panther, Falkner rid himself gently of
the baby and turned to Ruth. He ripped out a
sudden furious oath. She was empty-handed.
Somewhere between the spot where she stood and
the line fence the rifle had slipped unnoticed from
her cramped fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The outlaw was trapped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Throw up your hands!” came the curt order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the convict swerved and began running
to the right. Ruth stood directly in the line of fire.
The man with the gun took a dozen quick steps
to one side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop or I’ll fire!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner paid no attention. He was making for a
cottonwood arroyo back of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rifleman took a long aim and fired. The
hunted man stumbled, fell, scrambled to his feet
again, ran almost to the edge of the gulch, and sank
down once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man who had fired ran past Ruth toward the
fallen man. She noticed that he was Sheriff Matson.
It is doubtful if he saw her at all. Men emerged
from the bunk house, the stable, the corral, and the
house. Some were armed, the rest apparently were
not. One had been shaving. He had finished one
cheek, and the lather was still moist on the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The half-shaved man was her foreman, Jennings.
At sight of the mistress of the ranch he stopped.
She had knelt to pick up the crying baby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s the row?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sheriff Matson has just shot Mr. Falkner.”
She could hardly speak the words from her dry
throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Falkner! How did he come here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Baby and I were snowbound in the old Potier
cabin. He broke trail down for us and carried
Baby.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gad! And ran right into Matson.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the sheriff doing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Came in late last night with a posse. Word
had been ’phoned him that Falkner had been seen in
the hills heading for the Montana line. He aimed to
close the passes, I reckon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Stovall bore down upon them from the back
door of the house. Ruth cut her off without allowing
the housekeeper a word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No time to talk now, Mrs. Stovall. Feed Baby.
He’s about starved. I’ll look after this business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With Jennings striding beside her, Ruth went
across to the group surrounding the wounded man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he badly hurt?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of her own punchers looked up and answered
gravely: “Looks like, ma’am. In the leg. He’s
bleeding a lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sight of the blood trickling down to the white
snow for an instant sickened Ruth. But she repressed
at once any weakness. Matson she ousted
from command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop the bleeding with a tourniquet, Jennings;
then have him carried to the house—to Rowan’s
room. Sheriff, ’phone Doctor Irwin to come at once.
Better send one of your men to meet him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth herself flew to the house. She forgot that
she was exhausted, forgot that she had had neither
supper nor breakfast. The call for action carried
her out of her own needs. Before the men had arrived
with the wounded outlaw she was ready with
sponges, cold water, and bandages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Falkner had been made as comfortable as
possible, Ruth left him in charge of Norma Tait and
retired to the pantry in search of food. When
she had eaten she left word with Mrs. Stovall that
she was going to sleep, but wanted to be called when
Doctor Irwin arrived at the ranch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the housekeeper’s knock she awoke three hours
later, refreshed and fit for anything. Ruth had not
lived the past two years in outdoor Wyoming for
nothing. She had grown tough of muscle and strong
of body, so that she had gained the power of recuperation
with very little rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having examined the patient, Doctor Irwin retired
with Ruth and Sheriff Matson to the front porch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you think?” asked the young woman
anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“H’mp! Think—just missed a funeral,” he
snorted. “Bullet struck half inch from artery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’ll get well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I reckon. Know better later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When can I move him?” asked Matson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t know. Not for a week or two, anyhow.
You in a hurry to get him back to that hell where he
came from, Sheriff?” bristled the old doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not responsible for the pen, Doc,” answered
Matson evenly. “And by all accounts I reckon
Hal Falkner makes his own hell there. But I’m
responsible for turning him over to the warden. If
I could get him down to Wagon Wheel——”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you can’t!” snapped Irwin. “He’ll stay
right here till I think it safe to move him. It’s my
say-so, Aleck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sure. And while he’s at the Circle Diamond I’ll
leave a couple of men to help nurse him. He might
hurt himself trying to move before he’s really fit to
travel,” the sheriff announced with a grim little smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth was head nurse herself. For years she had
held a bitter resentment against Falkner, but it could
not stand against the thing that had happened. Put
to the acid test, the man had sacrificed his chances of
escape to save her and the baby. Alone, he could
have reached the Yerby ranch and gone through
one of the passes before Matson had closed it. With
her and the baby as encumbrances he had not dared
try the deeper snow of the upper hills. Because of
his choice he lay in Rowan’s room, wounded, condemned
to a return to Rawlins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never in his rough and turbulent life had the man
been treated with such gentle consideration. The
clean linen and dainty food were external effects of
an atmosphere wholly alien to his experience. Here
were kindness and friendly smiles and an unimaginable
tenderness. All three of the women were good
to him in their own way, but it was for Ruth that his
hungry eyes watched the door. She brought the
baby with her one day, after the fever had left him,
and set the youngster on the bed, where the invalid
could watch him play.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner did not talk much. He lay quiet for
hours, scarce moving, unless little Rowan was in the
room. Ruth, coming in silently one afternoon,
caught the brooding despair in his eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned to her gently. “What makes you so
good to me? You know you hate me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her frank, friendly smile denied the charge. “No,
I don’t hate you at all. I did, but I don’t now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m keeping Rowan away from you. It was my
fault he went there in the first place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but you saved Baby’s life—and mine, too.
If you had looked out only for yourself, you wouldn’t
be lying here wounded, and perhaps you would have
got away.” She flashed deep, tender eyes on him.
“I’ll tell you a secret, Mr. Falkner. You’re not half
so bad as you think you are. Can’t I see how you
love Baby and how fond he is of you? You’re just
like the rest of us, but you haven’t had a fair chance.
So we’re going to be good to you while we can, and
after you come back from prison we’re going to be
friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ice that had gathered at his heart for years
was melting fast. He turned his face to the wall and
lay still there till dusk. Perhaps it was then that he
fought out the final battle of his fight with himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mrs. Stovall came in with his supper he told
her hoarsely that he wanted to see Matson at once on
important business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff drove his car in the moonlight out from
Wagon Wheel. Ruth took him in to see Falkner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send for Jennings and Mrs. Stovall. She’s a
notary, ain’t she?” said the convalescent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth’s heart beat fast. “Yes. She was one
when she was postmistress. Her term hasn’t run
out yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All right. Get her. I want to make a sworn
statement before witnesses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Matson took down the statement as Falkner dictated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>I want to tell some facts about the Bald Knob sheep
raid that did not come out at the trial of Rowan McCoy.
When the party was made up to ride on that raid I wasn’t
included. They left me out because I had a grudge at
Tait. But I horned in. I followed the boys for miles,
and insisted on going along. McCoy objected. He said
the party was going to drive off the sheep and not to do
any killing. I promised to take orders from him. He laid
out a plan by which we could surprise the camp without
bloodshed, and made it plain there was to be no shooting.
Afterward he went over it all very carefully again, and we
agreed not to shoot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I lost my head when we was crawling up on the camp
and shot at the wagon. That was the first shot fired.
Tait came out and began shooting at us. Two or three
of us were shooting. I don’t know who killed him.
Gilroy ran out of the wagon to escape. McCoy hollered
to stop shooting, and ran forward. I must have been
crazy. I shot and killed Gilroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then McCoy ran to protect the herders. He wrestled
with me for the gun to keep me from shooting. None
of the other boys had anything to do with the killing of
Gilroy except me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was so dark that nobody knew whether McCoy or I
shot Gilroy. McCoy protected me, and said we were all
to blame, since we had come together. He never did tell
who did the shooting. I looked at his gun a little later,
and saw that he had not fired a shot from first to last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am making this statement of my own free will, and
under no compulsion whatever. I am of sound mind and
body, except for a bullet wound in my leg that is getting
better. My only reason for making it is that I want to
see justice done. The others have suffered too much already
for what I did.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Falkner signed the statement. It was witnessed
by Jennings and the two deputies. Mrs. Stovall
added the notarial seal of her office to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth put her head down on the little table where
the medicines were and cried like a child. At last—at
last Rowan would be free to come home to her.
Her long, long waiting was at an end. She could
begin to count the days now till her lover would be
with her again.</p>

<h3>GOOD NEWS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>R</span>UTH telephoned a message down to Wagon
Wheel to be wired to Governor McDowell
that night. It was impossible for her to
sleep, and after she had packed she lay awake for
hours planning the fight for Rowan’s freedom. She
found herself framing a passionate plea to the governor
and the board of pardons for justice to her
husband. She visualized the scene until it became
so real that she had to rise from bed, get into a loose
gown, and take notes of what she must tell them.
Not till nearly two o’clock did she fall into a broken
sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sheriff drove her and the baby to town next
morning. From here she sent Louise a telegram to
tell her they were on the way to Cheyenne. Matson,
with strong letters in his pocket from Haight and the
district judge recommending clemency, took the noon
train also to add the weight of his influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the train rolled into the station at Cheyenne,
Louise was waiting for them in her car. She and
Ruth, after the manner of their sex, shed a few happy
tears together in each other’s arms, while Matson,
rawboned and awkward, stood near holding Rowan,
junior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The board of pardons is to meet this afternoon
in Phil’s office, and you and Mr. Matson are to have
a hearing before it,” her friend told Ruth. “It’s
going to be all right this time, I do believe. I can
see Phil means to be reasonable. He’d better. I
told him I was going over to the ranch to live with
you if he didn’t pardon Rowan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What does he say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says that if Falkner’s statement is as strong
as your wire claimed the board will have to free all
four. Phil wants to push the whole thing through
as quick as he can for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s fine,” commented Matson. “Will it be
a parole or a pardon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Depends on the confession, Phil says,” Louise
declared. “He has wired the warden at Rawlins
to call in any of the four men if they are out on road
work. I expect that by this time Rowan and his
friends must guess there is something in the air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was not the first time that Ruth and her
attorney had appeared before the board of pardons.
From the very day of his conviction she had missed
no possible chance that might help her husband.
The members of the board had been very kind to her.
She had read admiration in their glances. But the
majority of them had voted against her request.
To-day somehow it was different. As soon as she
entered the inner office of the governor with Sheriff
Matson and Rowan, she knew that victory was in
sight. The cordial handshake of the chairman, a
fatherly old gentleman with Horace Greeley whiskers,
was more reassuring than promises. She felt
that his grip was congratulating her on the success
he anticipated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little Rowan prevented the meeting from being a
formal one. He wriggled free from his mother and
ran forward with arms outstretched to his friend the
governor. He insisted clamorously on having his
“tick-tock” to play with, and he experimented with
the pockets of his Excellency to find which one of
them had supplied the candy with which he had been
furnished earlier in the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth forgot all about the arguments she had
meant to present. Instead she told, between tears
and smiles, the story of the blizzard and its consequences.
The adroit questions of the governor drew
the tale of the adventure from her in a simple, dramatic
way. No doubt its effect was greater coming
from this slender, girlish mother with the dark, wistful
eyes and the touch of shyness in her manner.
Rowan’s lawyer, an expert with juries, knew when
to avoid an anticlimax by getting her out of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just before leaving his office for the night Governor
McDowell called Louise on the telephone. That
young woman beamed at what he said, and beckoned
Ruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phil wants to talk with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth took the receiver, her hand trembling.
“Hello!” she said. “Yes, it’s Ruth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have good news for you, my dear,” the voice
at the other end of the wire said. “Rowan and his
three friends are to be paroled at once. I am going
to make it a full pardon for Rowan and perhaps for
the others, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For years Ruth had been waiting for this news.
Now that it had come she did not weep or cry out or
do anything the least dramatic. She just said: “Oh,
I’m so glad! Thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been instructed by the board to tell you how
much it appreciates the game fight you made and
to add that it gives this parole with more pleasure
than any it has ever granted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When can I see Rowan? And when will he be
out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll be out just as soon as the papers can be
prepared, my dear. I’m coming right home to tell
you all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two more telegrams were flashed westward from
Ruth that night. One was to McCoy, the second to
Tim Flanders. The message to Flanders laid upon
him the duty of notifying the families of the paroled
men. Early next morning Ruth sent still another
telegram. It was addressed to Jennings, and gave
him instructions that made him get busy at once
looking after horses, saddles, pack saddles, a tent,
and other camping outfit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later in the day Rowan, junior, and his mother
entrained for Rawlins. The adventure before her
tremendously intrigued the interest of the young
wife. It was immensely more significant than her
marriage had been. All the threads of her life for
years had been converging toward it.</p>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><h1 id='ch34'>CHAPTER XXXIV</h1></div>

<h3>A HONEYMOON IN THE HILLS</h3>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>AM YERBY strolled up and down the station
platform. His wife clung to him on one side
and on the other trotted Boy, hand in hand
with his new-found father. Outwardly Rogers and
Cole took their good fortune philosophically, but the
Texan could not hide his delight at Missie, Boy, and
freedom. The habits of his former life began to
reassert themselves. His cheek bulged with a chew
of tobacco. As the old cowman grinned jauntily
at Ruth, who had come down to see the party off, he
chirruped out a stanza of a range song:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“Goin’ back to town to draw my money,</p>
<p class='line0'>Goin’ back home for to see my honey.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Only I don’t have to go home to see her. She
done come to see the old man. I tell you it’s great,
Miss Ruth. This air now; Lordee, I jus’ gulp it
down! But I’ll bet it ain’t a circumstance to that
on the Fryingpan. I’m sure honin’ to hit the old
trails again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth smiled through her tears. “Good days
ahead, Mr. Yerby, for all of us. We know just how
you feel, don’t we, Missie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you-all expect Mac to get in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some time this afternoon. Here comes your
train. We’ll see you soon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the train had gone Ruth walked back to the
hotel where she was staying. Governor McDowell
had given a complete pardon to all four of the cattlemen,
but Rowan had not yet reached town from the
distant road camp where he was working. The clerk
handed the young woman a letter. It was from
Jennings and was postmarked at a small town seventy
miles farther up the line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth reclaimed the baby from the nursemaid with
whom she had left him and went up to her room.
A man came swinging with crisp step along the dark
corridor. She would have known that stride anywhere.
A wave of emotion crashed through her. In
another moment she was in his arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Rowan—at last!” she cried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently they moved into the room and he held
her from him while he searched her face. Since last
he had seen her she had endured the sting of rain,
the bluster of wind, and the beat of sun. They had
played havoc with her wild-rose complexion and the
satin of her skin. She was no longer the hothouse
exotic he had married, a slip of a girl experimenting
with life, but a woman strong as tested steel. Here
was a mate worthy of any man, one with a vigorous,
brave spirit clad in a body of exquisite grace, young
and lissom and vital.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An incomparable mate for some man! But was
he the man that could hold her? His old doubts
asserted themselves in spite of the white dream of
her his heart had held through the years of their
separation. She had been loyal—never a woman
more so. But he wanted more than loyalty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps it was from him she got it. At any rate,
an unexpected touch of shyness lowered her lashes.
She caught up the baby and handed him to the
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here is your son,” she said, the colour glowing
in her cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan looked at the little being that was flesh of
his flesh and blood of his blood, and his heart went
out to the child in complete surrender. Something
primeval, old as the race, set him in an inner tumult.
The flame of life had passed through him to this
dimpled babe. The child was his—and Ruth’s. If
he lived to be a hundred, he would never again know
quite the ecstasy of that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To escape the tension of her feeling Ruth hurried
into explanations. “I’ve made all our arrangements
for the next three days. You’re not to ask me anything
about them. You’re going to be personally
conducted by me and Baby, and you’ll have to do
whatever we tell you to do. Do you understand,
sir?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled and nodded. This particular Ruth—the
one that gave gay, imperious orders—was an old
friend of his. His heart welcomed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently her plans included an automobile
journey. Within an hour they were driving through
a desert of sand and sagebrush toward the mountains.
They glimpsed in the distance a couple of antelope
shining in the sunlight. Once a sage hen whirred
from almost beneath the wheels of the car. Great
bare buttes rose in front of them and marched slowly
to the rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan asked no questions. He wondered where
she was taking him, but he was content to await
developments so long as he could sit beside Ruth
with the youngster on his lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Ruth her blood began to beat faster with
excitement. She was trying an experiment. If it
proved a failure she knew she would be very greatly
disappointed. Just now it seemed to her that she
had set the whole happiness of her life at stake. For
if Rowan did not look at it as she did, if his joy
in it did not equal her hopes, they would fail by
just so much of that unity of mind for which she
prayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They had left Rawlins before noon. It was well
into the middle of the afternoon before the driver of
the car stopped at a little two-store village deep in
the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We get out here,” Ruth told her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She settled with the owner of the car, and the man
started back to Rawlins. Opposite the store where
they had stopped was a corral. Ruth led the way
to it. Three horses were eating hay from a rack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan looked at them, then at Ruth. He had
recognized two of the animals, and the third one
showed on the flank the Circle Diamond brand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I to ask questions yet?” McCoy wanted to
know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you like,” she smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are we to ride home on the pinto and old Duke?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the sorrel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a pack horse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have supplies and a tent?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jennings brought them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took a deep breath of delight. For three days
and nights they would be alone, buried together in
the eternal hills. Such a home-coming as this had
been beyond his dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you—glad?” she asked, and her voice was
tremulous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad!” He spoke a little roughly to hide his
deep feeling. “If I could only let you know how I
feel! If I could!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her heart jumped with a sudden gladness. Rowan
did not want to meet his friends yet. He wanted to
be alone with her and the baby. This was to be,
then, their true honeymoon, the seal of their love for
each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan saddled the horses and packed the third
animal, throwing the diamond hitch expertly. His
wife watched him work. It was a joy to see how the
vigour of his spirit found expression in the economy of
his movements, in the certainty of his fingers, in the
easy power of the shoulders muscled so beautifully
where the bronzed neck sloped into them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently they were moving into the bigger hills.
They saw no more sage chickens or antelope, but as
they wound deeper into the mountains his keen eye
detected signs of life that escaped her observation.
He made her get down once to look at the trail of an
elk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve been following his trail from that pine
back there,” McCoy told her. “He’s a big fellow,
and he was on his way down to water. But he got
scared right here, I expect. Maybe he heard us
coming, or maybe he smelled a bear. Anyhow, he
plunged right into the aspens without waiting to say
good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know all that? I believe you’re
spoofing, as one of our riders, an Englishman, sometimes
tells me when I joke him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s left signposts all along the way. There’s
one track. See? And there’s another. They’re
big tracks and they are far apart. The spread of
his forefeet shows that he’s a bull. Now notice
where he broke the brush here and how trampled
down the young aspens are. His horn ripped the
bark clear off this tree. See how far from the ground
it is. That shows his height.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, but how do you know he was frightened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He dived into the brush mighty reckless. Why
didn’t he wait and turn off there by the big rock
where the going would be easy? I reckon he thought
he hadn’t time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They camped far up beside a mountain lake. He
pitched tent in a beautiful grove of wide-spaced
pines through which a brook sang its way down to
the lake. While he unpacked and made preparations
for supper Ruth took the rod to try her luck. When
she returned half an hour later the tent was pegged
down, young pine boughs cut and spread for a bed,
and the fire going for their meal. Rowan had the
water on to boil for coffee, and slices of bacon in the
frying pan ready to set upon the rocks that hedged
in his coals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I got the big fellow on a royal coachman. He
took it with a rush,” she explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>McCoy cleaned the fish in the brook and cooked
them in the pan when the bacon grease was ready.
They ate with the healthy appetite of outdoor animals
in the hills.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ruth told him the gossip of the ranch and of the
neighbourhood. She retailed to him what she knew
of the politics of the county. It pleased her that his
interest in these far-away topics was as yet perfunctory.
His world just now consisted of three
persons, and of the three she was the most important.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re going to lose Jennings,” she told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t he satisfied?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little imps of mischief danced in her eyes. “Not
quite, but I think he’s going to be. He has notions
of marrying a handsome widow with a sheep ranch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rowan looked at her quickly. “You don’t mean
Norma Tait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t I? Why not?” She added a corollary.
“Norma is growing younger every day. She has
learned to laugh again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad. Life plays some queer tricks, doesn’t
it? But maybe in the end things even up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From where she was cuddling the romping boy
Ruth looked up and made confession. “At first I
thought I wouldn’t bring him with us. I wanted
these first days to be ours—just yours and mine.
But that was selfish. He has as much right to you
as I have. Now I’m glad he is here. You won’t
think him in the way, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It did not seem to him necessary to answer that in
words. He took little Rowan into his arms and held
him there till the child fell asleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the baby was safely tucked up in the tent
Ruth and Rowan walked to the brow of the hill and
watched the murk mist settle down into the mountain
cañons and drive the purple glow into the lake.
They saw the stars come out one by one until the
heavens were full of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The day is dead,” he said at last in a low voice
which held the throb of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew that in his thoughts he was breasting
again the troubled waters that had swept them so far
apart. Her warm, strong little hand slipped into
his. Cheerfully she took up his words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, the day is dead—the long day so full of
sorrow for us both. But now the night has blotted
out our grief. We are at peace—alone—beneath
the everlasting stars.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could not yet quite escape the net. “I’ve
been a poor makeshift of a husband, Ruth. I’ve
brought you much worry and sorrow. And I’ve put
a stain on you and the boy that never can be wiped
out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve brought me all that makes life brave and
beautiful.” She turned her buoyant head, and in the
white moonlight her smile flashed radiant upon him.
“A new day is on the way to us, Rowan. The sun
will reach down into the valley there where you and
I have been lost in the fog, and all the mist will
vanish as if it had never been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man caught his breath sharply. She was so
fine! With superb courage and patience she had
fought for him. All good things that life had to
offer should be hers. Instead, he brought her the
poison of the penitentiary record to taint her future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something of this he tried to tell her. “I’m a
pardoned convict. Your friends will never let you
forget that—never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your friends are my friends. I have no others,”
she told him, eyes aglow. Then added, in a murmur:
“Oh, my dear, as if what anybody says matters now
between you and me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her faith was enough to save them both. He
threw away his prudent doubts and snatched her to
him. In his kisses the lover spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presently they walked back to the camp through
the gathering darkness. A great peace lay over their
world.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Jesi, a diminutive city of the Italian Marches, was the birthplace
of Rafael Sabatini, and here he spent his early youth. The
city is glamorous with those centuries the author makes live again
in his novels with all their violence and beauty.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Mr. Sabatini first went to school in Switzerland and from there
to Lycee of Oporto, Portugal, and like Joseph Conrad, he has
never attended an English school. But English is hardly an
adopted language for him, as he learned it from his mother, an
English woman who married the Maestro-Cavaliere Vincenzo</span>
Sabatini.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Today Rafael Sabatini is regarded as “The Alexandre Dumas
of Modern Fiction.”</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:x-small'>All who enjoyed the lurid lights of the French Revolution with Scaramouche,
or the brilliant buccaneering days of Peter Blood, or the adventures
of the Sea-Hawk, the corsair, will now welcome with delight a turn
in Restoration London with the always masterful Col. Randall Holles.</span></p>

As for Blood himself, he is a superman, compounded of a sardonic humor,
cold nerves, and hot temper. Both the story and the man are masterpieces.

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
